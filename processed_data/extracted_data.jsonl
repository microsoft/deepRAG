The first vehicle in line didn't visit the loading stop before one of the subsequent vehicles allocated to this transport did.\n2. A planned tractor switch wasn't executed because a new real-time vehicle allocation was received earlier than the planned switch.\n3. Vehicles planned to visit the final stop(s) of a tour are not used because an \"earlier in line\" vehicle was visiting the remaining stop(s) and therefore completing the tracking of the tour already.\n4.

{"id": "9662109", "content": "### Title\nVisibility Hub ETA Calculation\n\nVisibility Hub's ETA calculation is dependent on various factors. Having a time reference (such as a time slot / appointment time) defined for a stop is an highly important parameter in order to be able to provide an accurate ETA as well as an ETA status (on time / delayed).\n\nIn case one or multiple stops of a transport are missing such a time reference, this warning is shown, no matter [in which state the transport is](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6075108-tracking-cancelled-reasons-state-transitions). The effected stops are also mentioned as part of the warning so that it's easy to identify which stops suffer from an inaccurate ETA and missing on time / delayed status indication. Only \"Visited\" can be seen in this case.\n\n![Timeslot Missing Warning](The image displays transport details for a shipment that originated from Oulu, Finland, and was delivered to Muuga k\u00f6la Albert Heijn Base in Estonia. The main features include:\n\n- A status message indicating that timeslots for certain stops (Helsinki E.Leclerc Logistics and Tallinn Edka Hub) are missing, which may affect the estimated time of arrival (ETA) and delivery status.\n- A timeline showing the progression of the transport, with specific timestamps for each leg of the journey, including pickup in Oulu, deliveries to the logistics centers in Helsinki and Tallinn, and the final delivery in Muuga.\n- A green line on the map, tracing the route taken during the transport, connecting the various locations mentioned.\n- Additional interface elements like notifications, temperature logs, and an overall status indicating that the transport is completed.\n\nOverall, the image conveys logistical information related to the shipment's journey, highlighting key complexities along the way.)\n\n**Visibility Hub strongly recommends to have a time reference defined for each stop in the transport, as tracking success is heavily dependent on that.**\n\nNote that in case Visibility Hub wasn't able to confirm arrival/departure of a given stop based on the tracking data provided and the most likely reason is the missing time reference, the transport tracking is cancelled with the respective cancellation reason \"Timeslot missing\".

{"id": "9094621", "content": "### Title  \nContext of the \"Allocated license plate is not an integrated vehicle\" warning\n\nThis article explains the **context** of the \"Allocated license plate is not an integrated vehicle\" warning, **why** it\u2019s shown, whether it's a **problem** from a tracking point of view and **what** you can potentially do about it.\n\n## Context  \nVisibility Hub supports two ways of vehicle/license plate allocation:  \n1. License plates, which are received from telematics connections and represented as vehicle entities in the system and  \n2. License plates, which are received as a metadata on top of visibility data provided for a transport.  \n\n*To learn more details about that, see [here](https://transporeon-hcskb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ADPD/pages/27234348/FAQ+on+Visibility+APIs#What's-the-difference-between-providing-visibility-vehicle--or-transport-based%3F).*\n\n## Why is this warning shown?  \nThe license plate allocation itself can be done:  \na) directly in the Visibility Hub application or  \nb) via any other supported/connected application or interface.  \n\nIn case of a), the warning can\u2019t be triggered as only vehicles available in Visibility Hub\u2019s vehicle pool can be allocated.  \n\nIn case of b), if the intent of the license plate allocation was to **find a matching vehicle in Visibility Hub's vehicle pool (see scenario 1 above), but it wasn't found, this warning is shown.**\n\n## Is it a problem for tracking?  \nIt depends:  \n- **It is not a problem** as long as data is sent for this vehicle (see scenario 2 above) in time (latest at the start time of the transport, which is usually the start of the timeslot of the first stop).  \n- **It is a problem** if still no data is received after the start time of the transport.  \n\n## What can be done about it?  \nFirst, get in touch with the party who's responsible for providing the visibility data for the transport. Next, try to figure out in which way this party is providing the license plate allocations (see **Context** section above) to Visibility Hub.  \n- If it's (1), then the missing vehicle needs to be made available for Visibility Hub, which usually means to get in touch with the telematics provider.  \n- If it's (2), try to evaluate why no visibility data was provided for this transport.  \n\n### References  \n- [here](https://transporeon-hcskb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ADPD/pages/27234348/FAQ+on+Visibility+APIs#What's-the-difference-between-providing-visibility-vehicle--or-transport-based%3F) - FAQ on Visibility APIs", "title": "Warning: Allocated license plate is not an integrated vehicle", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/9094621-warning-allocated-license-plate-is-not-an-integrated-vehicle", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T11:58:11.055641", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}
{"id": "8753857", "content": "### Title  \nRequirements for Managing Places in Visibility Hub\n\nWhenever you send new transports to Visibility Hub by the means you have chosen (which is usually an interface from your inhouse system), you have two options to define the locations of the transport stops:\n\n1. Include the address data (street, house nr, city etc.) so that Visibility Hub can geocode the location (or alternatively provide geocoordinates directly).\n2. Use an existing Place and its location by directly referring to it.\n\nThe details of point 2 are described below. \n\n### How to  \nWhen creating a Place in Visibility Hub, you can set a reference ID by using the field \"**Set a reference ID**\" as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n![Set a Reference ID](The image displays a web interface for creating a new location entry, specifically for \"Manassas Park, US.\" \n\n1. **Title Section**: At the top, there's a field to set the name of the place, with \"Manassas Park\" already filled in.\n   \n2. **Geofence Definition**: Below this, there are options to define the shape of the geofence for the location, with options for \"Circular\" or \"Custom.\"\n\n3. **Addresses Section**: There's a section to select linked addresses, where one address is pre-checked: \"Chestnut Street 7620.\" Other addresses are also listed as possible aliases.\n\n4. **Reference ID**: A prominent box is highlighted, indicating a space for entering a \"Reference ID.\" This ID helps in referencing the place within an internal system, with a note that if left blank, the system will generate one automatically.\n\n5. **Map Area**: The right side features a map showing the surrounding areas, with a circular geofenced area outlined. Markers and labels indicate various locations within the map, providing geographical context.\n\n6. **Buttons**: At the bottom, there are buttons to \"Cancel\" or \"Create place,\" allowing for submission or exit from the process.\n\nOverall, the interface is straightforward and aims to assist users in adding and managing location data effectively.)\n\n**Note: Setting a reference ID is optional**, and if you don't want to create one yourself, Visibility Hub will automatically assign one after you have created the Place. You can always change the reference ID later in case you see need.\n\n### Impact  \nWhen you refer to an existing Place using the field `place_reference_id` (from the interface that you're using, see below) during the transport creation, Visibility Hub will directly use the address data, name and geofence definitions that were set up for the Place instead of geocoding the address and applying the system's geofencing logic.\n\n### Supported Interfaces  \nThe following APIs support using the `place_reference_id`:\n\n- Transporeon API for Shippers and Partners, see [here](https://api.transporeon.com/).\n- Transporeon Shipment Create API, see [here](https://developer.sixfold.com/api/shipment-create).\n\n### References  \n- Transporeon API for Shippers and Partners: [https://api.transporeon.com/](https://api.transporeon.com/)  \n- Transporeon Shipment Create API: [https://developer.sixfold.com/api/shipment-create](https://developer.sixfold.com/api/shipment-create)", "title": "Working with Places references", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/8753857-working-with-places-references", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T11:58:24.172286", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}

This process is called \"vehicle allocation\" and is done by assigning a vehicle via its license plate number to a transport described by its identification number.\n\n## Where it gets challenging  \nWhile this seems to be a rather easy task, one can imagine that with dozens or even hundreds of shipments a day, a manual allocation for visibility purposes is quite an overhead. This allocation is anyway done as part of the carrier\u2019s dispatching process and should therefore be automated. This can happen by sending this dispatch information from one machine (the carrier\u2019s in-house IT system) to another machine (Visibility Hub and Transporeon) in the background without a need for manual user interaction: This can be enabled with a so called \"API\", short for Application Programming Interface.\n\nSo far so good, but there\u2019s an important point to consider: Master data.  \nTo make the best out of such an API connection, it\u2019s critical that the vehicle and transport identification in both, the carrier\u2019s in-house IT system as well as Visibility Hub\u2019s system, are consistent. But that might sometimes not be the case:\n\n*For vehicles*, Visibility Hub retrieves the license plate number from the carrier\u2019s GPS provider. The carrier maintains the format in the web portal of the GPS provider. This license plate notation can deviate significantly from the one that is known to the carrier\u2019s in-house IT system. This is especially true, if vehicles are not directly owned by the carrier, but e.g. by a subcontractor.\n\n*For transports*, Visibility Hub retrieves various identifiers, which are exposed in different fields. Examples are the shipper\u2019s transport number, delivery, order number and others. As different customers might use different identifiers that are present in those fields, it\u2019s important to know where to find the correct one for a given customer. Also, the format or notation might slightly differ, which makes it hard for a machine (and even for a human) to identify the correct one.\n\n## But how can we solve these problems?  \nSmall recap of what we have learned so far: Master data for the license plate and transport identification can be differently maintained in systems. As it's not easy to fix it in every system (different stakeholders, responsibilities, data owner etc), we're looking for a different solution approach.\n\nTo combat these challenges, Visibility Hub released an API update that significantly improves the matching of vehicle license plates and transport identifications by using a smart algorithm. This algorithm allows the notation to differ between one system and another, even takes partial matches into account and looks up a lot of available data to make the (perfect) match. Don\u2019t worry, if this sounds complex to you, just take a look at the example below and you\u2019ll learn that it\u2019s quite simple.\n\n## Example  \nImagine you\u2019re in a bakery and you\u2019d like to get that incredible tasting bread that your friend recommended. You just can\u2019t remember exactly what it was called and where to find it, but you remember that it was a \u201c*whole grain bread*\u201d. You ask for it, and the friendly baker instantly knows that you\u2019d like to get the \u201cChristoph *whole grain bread* with pumpkin seeds\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how the API works:  \nYou ask for the vehicle with license plate number \u201cABC-123\u201d (like you have it in your in-house IT system) and the system will give you \u201cABC 123 Henry\u201d as a result, as that\u2019s how it\u2019s represented in Visibility Hub because of how the carrier maintained it in its GPS provider\u2019s portal. Same goes for transport identification: Say the identifier that you got from your customer on order retrieval is \u201cord-012345\u201d and that\u2019s how you have it stored in your in-house IT system. Now you don\u2019t know exactly in which field this identifier is present in the Visibility Hub system, and you also don\u2019t know if the notation is identical. But you ask for it, and as a result you\u2019ll get the correct transport, even if the identifier known to Visibility Hub is \u201cord012345-001-v2\u201d.\n\n## Benefit  \nNow you have the correct license plate and the correct transport identifier and your system sends this allocation information to the Visibility Hub system. Automated and in the background by machine-to-machine communication. In the same step where you dispatch the order internally. The result? Real-time visibility and happy customers.\n\n## What next?  \nLearn more about these enhancements and the API in general by looking at the Visibility Hub Developer Portal, which features a [usage guide](https://developer.sixfold.com/api/carrier) and the [technical specifications](https://developer.sixfold.com/api/carrier/spec).\n\nIf you have further questions or you want to get started using the API, [contact our support team](https://support.transporeon.com/).\n\n### References  \n- [Visibility Hub Developer Portal - Usage Guide](https://developer.sixfold.com/api/carrier)  \n- [Visibility Hub Developer Portal - Technical Specifications](https://developer.sixfold.com/api/carrier/spec)  \n- [Transporeon Support Team](https://support.transporeon.com/)", "title": "Automating visibility workflows with Visibility Hub Carrier API", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6167059-automating-visibility-workflows-with-visibility-hub-carrier-api", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T11:59:38.970130", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}

{"id": "6100089", "content": "### Title\nPossibilities for Allocating More Than One Truck to a Shipment in Visibility Hub\n\nIn this article you will learn about the possibilities for allocating more than one truck to a shipment in Visibility Hub. Also the connection with Transporeon will be covered here.\n\nIn the daily business of a transport planner, switching a truck happens quite regularly. It can be a planned situation to optimize transport operations but it can also happen more spontaneously, if e.g. a truck needs to be repaired and another one takes over a shipment.\n\n**How to do a tractor switch in Visibility Hub**\n\nThere are two main possibilities for performing a tractor switch directly in the Visibility Hub UI.\n\n- Real time allocation\n- Pre-planned allocation\n\n*Real time allocation*  \nWith real time allocation, one truck is simply unallocated from a shipment and another truck is allocated while the shipment is ongoing. This only works if you are logged in as a carrier user.\n\n1. Click on \u201cChange allocation\u201d in your detail transport view.\n2. You can modify the allocation, remove one vehicle, or even remove all allocations.\n3. Click on \u2018**Confirm Allocation**\u2019 below in order to confirm your changes.\n\n![Real Time Allocation](The image displays a transport tracking interface. Key elements include:\n\n- **Transport Number**: A unique identifier (344510380101802202-S).\n- **Origin and Destination**: It lists \"Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires Shwarz Warehouse\" in Argentina and \"Canning Selex Warehouse.\"\n- **User and Shipper Info**: There\u2019s an option to \"Add user,\" with the shipper listed as \"Berlin Beverages.\"\n- **Carrier Information**: The transport is handled by \"Himmel Express,\" and a license plate number (6YHW191) is provided.\n- **Time Zone**: The interface is set to Europe/Vienna (UTC +02:00).\n- **Weight**: The cargo is approximately 106 kg.\n- **Overview Section**: It indicates that tracking started and details the pickup location and time.\n- **Status**: The current status shows \"At delivery.\"\n- **Actions**: There\u2019s a button labeled \"Change allocation\" highlighted in red, along with options to share or stop tracking.\n\nOverall, it presents essential transport details and tracking functionality.)\n\n![Real Time Allocation Confirmation](The image shows a user interface for vehicle allocation. At the top, there are three tabs: \"Allocate a vehicle,\" \"Forward to subcontractor,\" and \"Allocate to mobile.\" \n\nIn the middle section, labeled \"VEHICLE,\" there is a field for entering a license plate number, which currently shows \"6AEA429.\" To the right of this field, there is a red \"X\" that likely allows the user to remove or cancel the entry. \n\nBelow, there is an option to \"Add another vehicle.\" Finally, at the bottom, there is a prominent button labeled \"Confirm allocation,\" which is highlighted in a light color against a red background, indicating it's an actionable item. The layout suggests it is part of a form for managing vehicle assignments.)\n\n*Stop based allocation*  \nIf you know from the start of the shipment that a tractor switch will happen, you can pre-plan the switch with our stop based allocation feature. \n\n1. After clicking on the \u201cAllocate\u201d button in your detailed transport view, select \u201cAdd another vehicle\u201d.\n2. Add the license plate of the truck that will take over the shipment.\n3. Don\u2019t forget to add the stop after which the switch will happen and confirm the allocation.\n\n![Stop Based Allocation](The image displays a user interface for tracking transport logistics. \n\n- At the top, \"Transport details\" includes a transport number and location (\"Seattle, BB Factory Seattle\").\n- There's a status section indicating that tracking has started and the vehicle is \"On time.\"\n- The allocation section shows a truck with the license plate \"6AEA429\" and options to manage vehicle allocation.\n- A button is highlighted in red that says \"Add another vehicle\" along with a confirmation button labeled \"Confirm allocation.\"\n\nTo the right, there's a map indicating the location, with a marker near \"Kirkland Metro Station.\" The general atmosphere reflects a transport management or logistics application.)\n\n![Stop Based Allocation Confirmation](The image displays a screen from a transport tracking application. It shows details for a specific transport with transport number \"64665032011802202-S\" and indicates that the transport is originating from \"BB Factory Seattle.\" \n\nKey elements include:\n\n- **Location**: The transport is near \"Kirkland Metro Station\" in Seattle, with a map view on the side.\n- **Status**: The status of the shipment is \"On time.\"\n- **Details**: \n  - The first vehicle's license plate is \"6AEA429.\"\n  - There is a section for entering details about a second vehicle, including fields for the license plate and a note about when a switch happens, which is indicated to occur after reaching \"BB Factory Seattle.\"\n  \nAdditional options include adding a user, sharing, stopping tracking, and confirming the vehicle allocation.)\n\n**What are other possibilities for a tractor switch?**  \nIf you don\u2019t allocate in the Visibility Hub UI (e.g. because your company is using an interface) it is still possible to perform a tractor switch.\n\nTractor switches are supported functionally in our API. The principle behind it is the same as if the allocation happens in the UI (pre-planned allocation & real time allocation). If you need further information on this, please contact [support.transporeon.com](http://support.transporeon.com).\n\nIf you are allocating via Transporeon, real time allocation is still possible. This means that you can simply change the allocated license plate in Transporeon. This information will be forwarded to Visibility Hub so that the tracking of the transport is continued with the correct vehicle.\n\nShould you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please reach out to [support.transporeon.com](http://support.transporeon.com).\n\n### References\n- [support.transporeon.com](http://support.transporeon.com): Contact support for further information and assistance.", "title": "Tractor Switching - a user guide", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6100089-tractor-switching-a-user-guide", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T12:00:31.939130", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}

We have grouped similar and most common issues into so-called **Tracking Cancelled** reasons that are in focus on this page.\n\nThis article\n- lists all of the **Tracking Cancelled** reasons\n- describes how Visibility Hub ended up with a specific reason\n- provides recommendations on what you can do to make tracking successful going forward.\n\n### Transport state transition\nThe following flowchart shows the different actions that trigger a transport state transition as well as which **Tracking Cancelled** reason is potentially applied [click to enlarge].\n\nIn certain situations, a transport can already be in **Cancelled** state when Visibility Hub receives\n- Vehicle allocation\n- Arrival/departure and similar events via an interface connection\n- GPS data from the allocated vehicle or from an interface connection\n- Transport update (e.g., time slots were updated or a stop got added/modified)\n\nIn this case, Visibility Hub changes the transport state back to **Tracking/Completed** respectively.\n\n### Tracking Cancelled reasons\nList of all tracking cancelled reasons:\n- [No vehicle/tracking data received](#h_710c83fe41)\n- [Tracking data missing for allocated vehicle](#h_8c739091cf)\n- [Timeslot missing](#h_f98684b267)\n- [No vehicle movement](#h_841c249cb9)\n- [Insufficient tracking data received](#h_2c7047f6b5)\n- [Tractor switch failed](#h_63170a9726)\n- [Truck movement mismatch](#h_1a34412fe7)\n- [Tracking cancelled manually](#h_9a1c51337b)\n- [Address missing or malformed](#h_059679a2a7)\n- [Carrier not registered](#h_70ee138902)\n- [Maximum visibility period exceeded](#h_7e8089ced6)\n- [Data sharing issue](#h_40b0dc7744)\n\nClick one of the tracking cancelled reasons to jump to the description.\n\n### No vehicle/tracking data received\nVisibility Hub didn't receive any vehicle information or tracking data in order to initiate the tracking. Such a transport will stay in Untracked state until it's moved into Cancelled state. Depending on how the carrier chose to provide visibility (for more details on that, have a look at the connection options [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-overview-connection-possibilities)), different actions need to be taken to resolve the situation:\n1. **Telematics integration of carrier's own vehicles:** Vehicle(s) that is (are) executing the transport need to be allocated. Provided that the vehicle's telematics data is being transmitted successfully, the situation should be resolved.\n2. **Telematics integration of subcarrier vehicles:** Similar to (1) above, either the carrier or the subcarrier owning the vehicle needs to allocate the vehicle to get the tracking initiated.\n3. **Inhouse system connection of the carrier:** Visibility data (like GPS pings or arrival/departure - and similar - events) need to be sent via the interface this carrier has set up between their inhouse system and Visibility Hub.\n\nIf you're a shipper and you don't know how your carrier chose to provide visibility, you can reach out to them and ask them to review [this overview](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-overview-connection-possibilities) about the Visibility Hub connection possibilities.\n\n### Tracking data missing for allocated vehicle\nVehicle information was provided (through one of the sources mentioned above), but no tracking data of this vehicle was received.\n\n**For vehicles integrated from a carrier or subcarrier via GPS (telematics) integration** (scenario 1 & 2 above), the vehicle owner needs to check with the telematics provider what causes the data transmission not to be operational.\n\n**For vehicle license plate information provided via a carrier inhouse connection** (scenario 3 above), it should be checked if data was sent at all and whether it was valid or not.\n\nUsually, the interface used to communicate with Visibility Hub provides immediate feedback in case the data sent was invalid and couldn't be used to track the transport. If you're unsure, [reach out to our support](https://support.transporeon.com/).\n\n### Timeslot missing\nIt can happen that some stops of a transport do not have any time reference (i.e., a timeslot, appointment time, from/to planned time) defined. This is fine as long as at least one stop has a time reference indicated.\n\nIf a stop that doesn't have a time reference defined couldn't be tracked (which means Visibility Hub wasn't able to confirm arrival/departure based on the tracking data provided), this tracking cancelled reason is shown.\n\nThe transport owner should define a time reference for the problematic stop(s). Note that Visibility Hub highly recommends having a time reference for all stops in a transport to have accurate ETA calculation and ETA status definitions (on time / delayed).\n\n### No vehicle movement\nWhen GPS data is received for a vehicle on a transport, but it either stands still or only has minor movements (like maneuvering on a warehouse yard or going back and forth from a rest area to a gas station), this cancellation reason is shown.\n\nDepending on how GPS data is provided, the carrier should check the vehicle's telematics system configuration (or in doubt, reach out to the telematics provider) or check if there's something wrong when sending GPS data from the inhouse system.\n\n### Insufficient tracking data received\nGPS tracking data was received, but it was not enough to complete tracking. Within the cancellation reason, you can see\n- the portion of the **transport distance**\n- the portion of the **timeframe** as well as\n- **how many stops** Visibility Hub managed to track with the data provided.\n\nVisibility Hub detects this cancellation reason when one of these two conditions is met:\n- No loading stop has been visited and all unloading stops were visited\n- No vehicle has approached any unloading stop close enough\n\nThe tracking data provider (carrier, subcarrier) should check if the *correct* tracking data was provided and if *additional* tracking data from other vehicles involved in this transport is potentially missing.\n\nHave a look at [this article](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4356655-how-to-allocate-multiple-trucks) for how to provide tracking data from multiple vehicles on one transport.\n\n### Tractor switch failed\nApplies on the following conditions:\n- Multiple vehicles are involved in the transport execution\n- Vehicles were allocated to a transport beforehand (i.e., they were planned upfront)\n- It was expected that the tracking should switch from one vehicle (usually a tractor) to another\n\nWhen the switch from one vehicle to another is not detected, this tracking cancelled reason is shown. The most likely reason is that the switch from one vehicle to another was not detected by the means Visibility Hub supports (see [this article](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6100089-tractor-switching-a-user-guide) for more details).\n\nMind that this cancellation reason is only shown when it's not an [Insufficient tracking data received](#h_2c7047f6b5) case.\n\n### Truck movement mismatch\nWhenever Visibility Hub receives tracking data for a transport that does not really match the transport plan (which involves the stops and their locations), this cancellation reason is shown.\n\nThe following are examples of such scenarios:\n- The stops were not visited as planned\n- The tracked route deviated a lot from the projected one\n- The vehicle is going back and forth without a clear pattern in respect to the stop locations\n- The addresses/locations used in the system do not match with the actual stops locations.\n- Etc.\n\nIt means that some tracking data was received, but no matter how hard we tried, we couldn't make a meaning out of it.\n\n### Tracking cancelled manually\nIn this case, a user cancelled the tracking manually by clicking the stop tracking button in the application as shown below [click to enlarge]:\n\nIf the tracking was cancelled manually, it's final and therefore not possible for the transport to transition back to **Tracking** state, even if tracking updates are still received (see the \u201c[Transport state transition](#h_33bdf893dc)\u201d section for more details).\n\n### Address missing or malformed\nBased on the address data provided, Visibility Hub wasn't able to figure out the location of the respective stop(s) in the transport. As stop locations are the basis for tracking, it wasn't possible to proceed.\n\nThe transport owner should check the address data provided on the respective stop and update it accordingly. As an alternative, geo positions can be sent directly, or a Visibility Hub Place can be created.\n\nHave a look at [this article](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5052924-create-a-new-place) to learn more about Visibility Hub Places.\n\n### Carrier not registered\nIf a transport is received where the assigned carrier isn't registered* on Visibility Hub yet, this cancellation reason is shown.\n\n*Each carrier is asked to register and set up a tracking data connection that Visibility Hub offers. Have a look at the [connection possibilities for carriers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-overview-connection-possibilities) to learn more about the different options.\n\nYou can invite the carrier by using the invite functionality as part of the Visibility Control Center. Have a look at [this article](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6023034-visibility-control-center-for-shippers-lsps) to learn more.\n\n### Maximum visibility period exceeded\nThe time between the scheduled start and end of this transport is too long.\n\nIf Visibility Hub receives a transport where the timeframe between the earliest stop time reference (i.e., timeslot) compared to the last one is longer than 90 days, tracking is not initiated and this cancellation reason is shown. For privacy reasons (e.g., to avoid showing unrelated tracking data), such transports are not allowed.\n\nMake sure to create transports where the timeframe is less than the above-mentioned period to ensure that tracking can be initiated respectively.\n\n### Data sharing issue\nWhen there is no consent between the involved stakeholders on a transport (usually the shipper and the carrier) to exchange data, Visibility Hub does not track transports. You can resolve this situation by giving consent to share tracking data between you and your partner.\n\nIf you're a shipper, have a look at the [Consent Management for Shippers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014082-consent-management-for-shippers) article.\n\nIf you're a carrier, have a look at the [Consent Management for Carriers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014068-consent-management-for-carriers) article.\n\n### References\n- [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-overview-connection-possibilities): Connection options for carriers.\n- [this overview](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-overview-connection-possibilities): Overview of Visibility Hub connection possibilities.\n- [reach out to our support](https://support.transporeon.com/): Customer support link.\n- [this article](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4356655-how-to-allocate-multiple-trucks): How to provide tracking data from multiple vehicles on one transport.\n- [this article](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6100089-tractor-switching-a-user-guide): Article on tractor switching.\n- [this article](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5052924-create-a-new-place): Learn about Visibility Hub Places.\n- [connection possibilities for carriers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-overview-connection-possibilities): Learn more about options.\n- [this article](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6023034-visibility-control-center-for-shippers-lsps): Visibility Control Center for shippers and LSPs.\n- [Consent Management for Shippers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014082-consent-management-for-shippers): Consent Management for Shippers article.\n- [Consent Management for Carriers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014068-consent-management-for-carriers): Consent Management for Carriers article.", "title": "\"Tracking cancelled\" reasons & state transitions", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6075108-tracking-cancelled-reasons-state-transitions", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T12:01:01.170896", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}

With carriers actively deciding to share data, the quality of Real-time visibility will increase, giving you an even better overview over your supply chain.\n\n**What does data sharing mean?**  \n\nSharing Real-time visibility data means that an allocated vehicle will provide real-time data for a given transport.  \n\nWhen an allocated license plate is connected to Visibility Hub, our system will check if consent was given to share data with you. Once this is verified, GPS data will be shared for the specific transport.\n\n**Your visibility control center**  \n\nUnder the tab \u201cCarrier Network\u201d you see all the Transport companies working with you. Here you can also invite carriers to join your network.  \n\nThe consent status shows which carriers have accepted or declined to share data with you during a transport.\n\n**Accepted**  \nThe carrier has agreed to share real-time visibility data from his network with you during a specific transport.\n\n**Declined**  \nThe carrier has actively declined sharing real-time visibility data with you.\n\nIf a carrier has declined the data sharing, you will see this in your transport network. Also if a transport is executed by a carrier who declined data sharing, you will be informed about a data sharing issue, when the transport was supposed to start.\n\n**Note:** If a carrier has accepted to share data but you still get a notification about a data sharing issue, there could be missing consent in the private transport network of the carrier. Ask your carrier to check the consent status of his carrier network.\n\nIf a carrier has declined the data sharing, reach out to the carrier directly and ask for the consent to be reactivated. This can be done by an admin user in just two clicks. ([Find out if you are an admin](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/8473503-user-roles-in-visibility-hub))\n\n**Best practice**  \n- Check out your carrier network on a regular basis to make sure consent is accepted - and ask the same of your carriers.  \n- Ask your carriers to make sure they have invited all their subcontractors they are using for your transports.  \n\nShould you have any further questions please contact [support.transporeon.com](https://support.transporeon.com/).\n\n### References  \n- [Find out if you are an admin](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/8473503-user-roles-in-visibility-hub)  \n- [support.transporeon.com](https://support.transporeon.com/)", "title": "Consent Management for Shippers", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014082-consent-management-for-shippers", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T12:01:33.552961", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}

The overall design is clean, minimalist, and user-friendly.)\n\n## How can you create a dashboard?\nTo create a new dashboard please use the button \"new dashboard\" at the bottom of your page or select it from the drop down menu. It is mandatory to add a name to the dashboard. The name is indexed and it is possible to find it via the search bar later on. Optionally, a description of the dashboard can be added which will be visible at the top of the dashboard.\n\n![Creating a dashboard](The image shows a dashboard interface, likely from a software or application. At the top, there's a title that reads \"Dashboard.\" Below that, there's a dropdown menu labeled \"Berlin Warehouse,\" indicating the current selection.\n\nOn the left side of the dashboard, there are several icons that may represent different functionalities or sections. The main area of the dashboard is empty, displaying a message that states, \"This dashboard doesn't have any widgets yet,\" suggesting that no additional features or tools have been added.\n\nThere is also a prompt encouraging users to \"Add widgets to make it more practical\" and a button labeled \"New widget\" in yellow. At the top right, there's a search bar for transports. Overall, the layout is clean and minimalistic, focusing on user interaction for customization.)\n\n## Add Widgets to your dashboard\nThe dashboard consists of user defined widgets. A widget is a certain set of criteria, defined by you or your colleagues. With it, the number of shipments that fulfill the criteria can be accessed directly.\n\n![Widgets example](The image depicts a dashboard interface for tracking transport logistics, labeled \"Dashboard.\" It displays information related to the Amsterdam Warehouse. \n\nKey metrics presented include:\n\n1. **All Delayed Transports**: 72 (indicating a delayed status).\n2. **All On-Time Transports**: 118 (indicating an on-time status).\n3. **Delayed More than 60 Minutes**: 3 (specific to selected places).\n4. **At Loading Site**: 46 (related to a specific site).\n5. **Unallocated Transports**: 210 (not assigned to any specific location).\n\nThere are options for tracking and seeing conditions for each metric. The layout has a clean design with sections clearly divided and some buttons for functionality like adding a new widget. The dashboard appears to be regularly updated to reflect the most current transport status.)\n\nWidgets can be added via the \u201cnew widget\u201d button. After that the criteria can be set. Widgets can be re-arranged within the dashboard view. You can drag them via the handle bar on top of the widget. **Important:** only the dashboard owner can re-arrange the widgets.\n\n## How to create a Ratio Widget\nThe ControlTower Dashboard also enables you to display values in percentages (e.g., what percentage of transports was delayed). This feature is called the Ratio Widget and it can be applied to determine the ratio between two defined sets of parameters. The ratio widgets are updated in real-time and help to provide situational awareness of operational KPIs.\n\nHow to create a ratio widget:\n\n1. When you click \u201cCreate new widget\u201d, you\u2019ll see two options:  \n   - Count Widget  \n   - Ratio Widget  \n\n![Ratio widget options](The image shows a digital dashboard interface for managing ongoing transports related to Tesco. The upper part displays a summary with a count of 10 transports currently \"on route for loading,\" specifically indicating that these are delayed as of the current week, with a note about the arrival time at the Tesco EU central warehouse in Berlin. \n\nThere's also a section showing options to add a widget to the dashboard, with choices between a \"Count widget,\" which counts transports matching specific conditions, and a \"Ratio widget,\" which compares percentages between two sets of transports. This interface appears to be designed for efficient tracking and management of transport logistics.)\n\n2. After selecting the ratio widget, our system will guide you through the creation process. You will have to choose a name for the widget and provide conditions that should be applied to the ratio widget.\n\n![Creating a ratio widget]([Description for https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/609184588/3dc574bdbfebefa365ddfbe1/Kapture+2022-11-02+at+14.54.02.gif?expires=1731357000&signature=9a5d765346bd88f4406a1102a55c22647c2419db6821f25fda602176a5fc5d1f&req=ciAuF8F6mIlXFb4f3HP0gOL38QFzreP9Fqi78JyBLbVeAmDbfxPMBCB6Sijw%0AuBk%3D%0A not available due to error.])\n\nThe conditions are defined by you and range from specific places and carriers to transport features (e.g., delayed). The widget will divide the sample condition by the base condition. This way a comparison displayed in percentages is achieved. You will be able to see a preview of the selected conditions and a preliminary result.\n\n3. When you selected all the relevant parameters and clicked \u201cSave\u201d the ratio widget is added to the dashboard. If you want to explore the transports behind the calculation, click on the values displayed at the bottom of the widget (e.g., \u201c12 transports out of 36\u201d). This will take you directly to the list of these transports.\n\n![Ratio widget example](The image displays a dashboard interface likely related to logistics or transport management. It shows several key points:\n\n1. **Title**: The dashboard is titled \"Ongoing Transports for Tesco\" and indicates that it's updated in real-time.\n2. **Transport Status**: It mentions there are \"10\" transports currently \"On route for loading,\" along with details about delays (specifically, delayed by at least 60 minutes) and estimated arrival times.\n3. **Transport Performance**: There\u2019s a statistic indicating that 33% of transports from the previous week were either delayed or completed, with a breakdown stating \"12 transports out of 36.\"\n4. **Contact Information**: It suggests contacting a person named Emmett Brown for questions.\n5. **Interactivity**: Options for seeing conditions and adding new widgets are visible in the layout.\n\nThe overall design suggests it is meant for tracking logistics efficiently, with clear statistics and user-friendly features.)\n\n## How to specify a customer in a widget\nIf you wish to specify a customer in the widget creator, please be aware that the customer must be created as a \u201cplace\u201d first. Please go to the Places section of the ControlTower user interface, and create the relevant places for your business. (If you are unable to create new places, please reach out to an admin user). The widget creator will automatically extract the places, and make them available for selection.\n\n## Delay Time filtering\nDelay time filtering can be specified as \"more than\", \"less than\" and \"between\". The required delay duration is specified in minutes, hours and days. Hours and days can be expressed in full hours/full days.\n\n![Delay time filtering](The image displays a user interface labeled \"Edit widget\" with various dropdown menus and options to configure settings. There are sections for \"EXCEPTIONS\" and \"TIME PERIOD.\" \n\nIn \"EXCEPTIONS,\" options include:\n- User (set to \"All\")\n- Status (set to \"Tracking\")\n- Delay status (set to \"Delayed\")\n- Delay time, which has a dropdown selection showing options like \"Between,\" \"Less than,\" and highlighted \"More than,\" along with a space to input time in \"minutes.\"\n- Additional fields for \"Warnings\" and \"Working stop.\"\n\nIn the \"TIME PERIOD\" section, there are fields for \"Start time\" and \"End time,\" both set to \"All time.\"\n\nAt the bottom, there are buttons to \"Delete,\" \"Cancel,\" and \"Save,\" suggesting this is a form or interface for adjusting tracking settings.)\n\n## Filtering based on stop duration\nWithin our dashboards and filter functionality, you have the possibility now to filter for **time at stop**. What does this mean? If you open the filters and select a working stop (at pickup or at delivery) the \u201ctime at stop\u201d filter will appear. With it you can filter for vehicles that are at a stop for an amount of time defined by you. \n\nWith it, you now have the possibility to have even better exception management with filtering for vehicles waiting at a stop.\n\n![Filtering stop duration](The image displays a user interface for editing a widget. The section highlighted is labeled \"EXCEPTIONS,\" which includes various options. \n\n1. **Status**: Set to \"Tracking.\"\n2. **Delay status**: Selected as \"All transports.\"\n3. **Warnings**: Currently showing \"No warnings.\"\n4. **Working stop**: Set to \"At pickup.\"\n5. **Time at stop**: There is a dropdown menu with the option \"More than\" selected, likely for specifying a duration in minutes.\n\nAt the bottom of the interface, there are options to \"Delete,\" \"Cancel,\" and \"Save.\" The design uses a clean layout with dropdown menus for selections.)\n\n## Sharing dashboards\nAt the point of creation your dashboard (including widgets) is private to you. You can decide to share the created dashboard by clicking the ... in the top right corner and select the \u201cshare\u201d option. In the drop down menu, you have 3 options:\n1. Only you (access is limited to the creator of the dashboard).\n2. Select people (access is limited to the creator of the dashboard and the selected users).\n3. Entire company (access is granted to all users on the same portal).\n\nNote: The creator of the dashboard is the \"owner\" of the dashboard and the contents of it. Only this person is able to modify widgets etc.\n\n![Sharing dashboard](The image displays a dashboard interface related to transport logistics, specifically for the \"Amsterdam Warehouse.\" \n\nKey elements include:\n\n- **Header**: Shows the title \"Dashboard,\" indicating the overall purpose of the page.\n- **Transport Data Panels**: \n  - **All delayed transports**: 76 transports, marked as delayed.\n  - **All on-time transports**: 115 transports, marked as on time.\n  - **Delayed 60 minutes**: 6 transports that are delayed over 60 minutes.\n  - **At loading site**: 48 transports currently at the loading site.\n  - **Unallocated transports**: 211 transports that are currently unallocated.\n  - **Transports to Germany**: 78 transports with stops in selected countries.\n\nEach panel includes tracking status and options to view more conditions. There\u2019s also a search bar and an option to add a \"New widget.\" The layout is clean and organized, with a color scheme that likely emphasizes important information.)\n\n## Duplicate Dashboards\nIt's possible to duplicate a dashboard. When a dashboard is duplicated, all widgets will be copied to a new dashboard copy. The new copy can be re-named, and the widgets can be updated according to the users needs/requirements.\n\n## What happened to your existing filters?\nThe filters have been moved to the transport view. You have new options for editing and working with your filters there.  \nIn the Transport list view, you can access the list of saved filters. In the saved filters list, you have the ... option. Under this option you can see all customer portal related features. Please note that a filter needs to be promoted to a \"company filter\" before it can be enhanced to a customer portal.

{"id": "5885750", "content": "### Title\nVisibility Hub Transport Tracking\n\nVisibility Hub tracks transports by using the transport information (loading/unloading locations and timeslots) and the GPS updates of the allocated vehicle.\n\nIt is quite common that 2 or more full truckload transports having the same loading locations and overlapping loading timeslots are being allocated to the same vehicle.\n\nTracking of a transport is started once the vehicle arrives at the loading location at the right time i.e. within the timeslot provided with the transport information. If there are 2 or more transports supposed to be loaded in the same location at the same time, Visibility Hub needs to decide which of the transports to track first.\n\n**Note:** The following only applies if the transports differ from each other at least by timeslot or location. If they are exactly the same and also have the same vehicle allocated, they will be tracked in parallel.\n\nTransports allocated to the same vehicle are ordered by the loading timeslot start (earliest first) and tracking is started by that order. Next transports in the order will stay waiting for the vehicle to return to the loading location after the first transport has been completed.\n\nLet's look at an example, with three transports allocated to the same vehicle as follows:\n\n- Transport A - loading location Paris, timeslot: 23rd January 15:00-23:00\n- Transport B - loading location Paris, timeslot: 23rd January 09:00-16:00\n- Transport C - loading location Paris, timeslot: 23rd January 13:00-17:00\n\nAs these transports have the same loading location and overlapping timeslots, Visibility Hub tracking engine is ordering these transports by the loading timeslot start time:\n\n- Transport B - loading location Paris, timeslot: 23rd January 09:00-16:00\n- Transport C - loading location Paris, timeslot: 23rd January 13:00-17:00\n- Transport A - loading location Paris, timeslot: 23rd January 15:00-23:00\n\nTracking is started based on that order, so transport B is tracked first, transport C as second and transport A as third.\n\n### References\n(No references were provided in the HTML content.)", "title": "Tour Association", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5885750-tour-association", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T13:32:31.380349", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}

{"id": "5800433", "content": "### Title\nTypes of emissions\n\nProper emission accounting requires looking at a full lifecycle of fuel. Direct transport emissions are not only what is coming out from the exhaust pipe: drilling and manufacturing of the fuel, transporting to the gas station has its own footprint which has to be taken into account. Also production of trucks, building and maintenance of roads, etc are part of transport emissions. This chain can go quite far, but in practice and according to the GHG Protocol the following scopes for fuel emissions are calculated:\n\n- **Well-to-Tank** (WtT or W2T) - production and transportation of one liter of fuel.\n- **Tank-to-Wheel** (TtW or T2W) - all what happens \"after tank\", i.e. direct emission of CO\u2082 (and other gases) from the vehicle internal combustion engine.\n- **Well-to-Wheel** (WtW or W2W)- sum of the two above, **total life cycle** emission - this is the main figure you want to use for reporting and other uses.\n\n### Key terms and definitions\n\n- **CO\u2082e intensity** or **specific emission**. Shows how much emissions are created to move **one tonne** of goods for **one kilometer**, i.e. how effective is the transport. This is a more suitable measure for comparisons than the raw CO\u2082e, because the total raw number depends also on the distance and the weight of goods. Unit: \u201cgrams per tonne-km\u201d, meaning how many grams to move one metric ton for one km was emitted. Typical truck transport value is about 80 g per t-km, and lower value is better.\n- **Carbon Data Index** shows how good data input was given to be used for calculations. If only shipper data is given, then this is low (below 20%), if also carrier primary data is available then it is higher, up to 100%. Higher is better. See details below.\n- **Scope 3 Coverage Rate**: the share of transports that have emission calculated. In general we try to calculate at least default-based emissions for 100% transports, but sometimes it is not possible due to missing or incorrect data. Typical data issues are inaccurate addresses, missing stop coordinates or completely wrong coordinates so route cannot be found.\n- **Total CO\u2082e** - CO\u2082 equivalent, standard industry measure which factors in all emitted greenhouse gases (not only CO\u2082, but also methane etc) with their respective impact. Unit: metric tonne. Lower value is better, but if number of transports or distance increases then it goes up, so for comparison intensity is often better measure.\n- **Transport Performance** shows quantity of transports - in tonne-kilometers.\n- **CO\u2082e reduction potential** shows maximum reduction with \u201c**optimal scenario**\u201d which means lowest possible emission for specific set of transports/lanes. Usually, the lowest emission is rail transport, so effectively this is the difference between road and rail transport.\n\nCarbon measures are as default in metric units (grams, kilograms or tons), but users can choose 'imperial' units for US customary system (us tons and lbs).\n\n### Levels of calculation\n\nWe use the following three main levels of calculation depending on the input data that is available for each transport:\n\n- **Default** calculation uses minimal data - loading and unloading locations. If available for given transport, we use weight, mode of transport and general truck properties (e.g. whether it is reefer), otherwise we use standard defaults.\n\n#### Update April 2023: \n**Following calculation methods are moved to new Carbon Intelligence product and are not available in reports here.**\n\n- **Modeled** calculation is more accurate and also takes into account the **real route distance** from RTV (telemetry we received from the allocated truck, trailer or IoT device), as well as more truck properties (if available).\n- **Primary** data calculation collects **direct fuel consumption** or CO\u2082 emission data from the vehicles (and trailer if applicable) and uses fuel conversion factors to get accurate values for emissions. Fuel consumption data is available from more advanced telemetry systems. By default we use base factor 3.17 kg Well-to-wheel (2.54 Tank-to-Wheel) CO\u2082e per litre of fuel for road, and add 20% for industry average assumed empty miles.\n\n**Modeled** and **Primary** calculation levels require that the carrier is providing proper RTV for specific transport. Visibility Hub shows clearly which level of calculation was used and keeps different calculation levels as separate fields. Visibility Hub calculates RTV-based emissions at the end of the tour when we gather all relevant info about the transport. We keep track and can export all relevant parameters of the calculation, as well as specific tour metadata, like driven distance or measured liters of fuel. These can be made available for further validation and analysis.\n\n### Calculation input and defaults\n\nCarbon footprint depends on several variables as input. We list the most important variables together with their defaults:\n\n- Estimated distance is calculated automatically from the shortest route between **loading and unloading locations** - **both locations are mandatory**.\n- **Transport mode**: road, rail, sea or ocean ship, air, inland waterways - all have very different footprints. Default: road (or ocean if road route is not possible). For \"multimodal\" transports, we try to split them to single mode legs and give emission for each separately.\n- **Gross weight** of cargo. Default: 24 tons (for road).\n- **Empty run factor**. Default: +20% for road, +50% for rail.\n- **Load factor**. How much of full truck capacity is used, by weight. Default: 60%.\n- **Type and size** of vehicle, depending on mode: trucks, trailers (e.g. reefer creates extra emissions), ships, trails. Default for road: depends on country; Class40 in most EU countries, Class60 in Nordic countries. Smaller trucks like vans have significantly higher emission intensity.\n- **Fuel type**. Default: diesel.\n- **Bio fuel** share. Depends on country, European average 5.43%.\n- Truck emission class (for road). Default: EuEuro6.\n- Used fuel amount. Default: assume average fuel consumption per km. Loaded automatically from RTV telemetry, if available.\n- If RTV is working for specific transport, then we recalculate footprint based on real travelled distance. So if the real route was e.g. 30% longer then also the emission result would become correspondingly bigger.\n\nWith more data we give always more accurate calculations and you see generally lower emission intensity values.\n\n**It is important that shipper provides as many real transport values as possible** and avoids using defaults. The values must be given in **standard parameters** as standard values, not as part of textual descriptions or customer-specific fields of transports. Interface adjustment is usually needed to implement this properly.\n\n**Loading and unloading locations** must be present in one of the following ways:\n\n- Geographical coordinates: latitude and longitude - suggested for all\n- Country and Postal Code (zip) - suggested for all (used for trade lane grouping)\n- UN/LOCODE (for ocean transports)\n- IATA Airport Code (for air transports)\n- UIC Country/Code for Rail Station (for rail transports)\n\nVisibility Hub carbon emission calculation service is certified by SmartFreightCenter for GLEC framework compliance.\n\n### Transport modes\n\nDepending on how transports are provided to the Carbon Visibility service, the transport modes are specified a bit differently. Two ways how transport data is given:\n\na) transports which are **uploaded** for carbon calculation specifically\n\n- Single mode transports have simply specific optional field \"Mode\": road, rail, ocean, inland waterways or air.\n\n- For intermodal transports with multiple modes there are the following options:\n  (1) Most accurate result, suggested: **split transport by mode** and add each mode as separate transport delivery.\n  (2) If the split details are not known, but main mode is known (e.g. ocean transport but ports are not known) - **specifiy main mode**. Then we use nearest ports to loading and unloading as guessed ports.\n  (3) Sometimes mode is not known at all, e.g. overland intermodal container transports. Mode can be left, then we use \"**assume road if possible**\" heuristics, same as for \"Transporeon transports\". It should be used as the last resort and it will result in the highest conservative emission estimates.\n\n- Provided Excel template includes samples for different modes.\n\nb) Transporeon (**Transport execution service**) **existing transports**, automatic carbon calculation.\n\n- Transporeon transport management historically does not have standard field for transport mode. Transporeon customer connection integration needs to be updated to include **transport.mode** with one of the standard options as value. This usually requires **custom customer project** with Transporeon and customer IT involvement.\n- Customer may have mode indication somehow in vehicle requirement or in a customer-specific parameter field, but emission calculations cannot use these fields directly. Therefore it is handled as \"undefined\" mode, where we use a simple \"**assume road if possible**\" heuristical rule: (1) if there is road connection between loading and unloading, then we use road, (2) else (e.g. Europe or Asia to America) we **assume ocean**. This is generally good heuristics, but it also leads to a few known issues:\n  - Technically there are long haul intercontinental road connections between Europe, Africa and Asia, therefore these routes do get calculated as road connections. For example, there is road even from Japan to Germany, which is not often (or maybe ever) used, and it can lead to overestimate of carbon footprints on these routes.\n  - Ferry lanes are also part of the road network, therefore some quite long overseas trips e.g. Germany to Iceland are calculated as road-connected.\n\nFollowing table illustrates the approach to different modes and what would happen if these get unspecified or specified wrong.\n\n### Carbon Data Index\n\nTransporeon uses its own method **Carbon Data Index (CDI)** to measure and show input data completeness for every transport. CDI is in scale from 0% to 100%, and maximum index value 100% is when all the carbon calculation relevant data elements are present from all the needed parties. It is not simple to get to 100% - also fuel type and biofuel share, real (and not default) empty miles etc must be known. Carriers and shippers can see their aggregated scores with suggestions on how to improve it, often operations and technical developments by all sides (including Transporeon) have to be done.\n\nFollowing figure shows different components of CDI and how to get it higher; the exact formula is in continuous development.\n\n### References\n- [GLEC framework](https://www.smartfreightcentre.org/en/how-to-implement-items/what-is-glec-framework/58/)", "title": "Carbon Visibility Methodology", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5800433-carbon-visibility-methodology", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T13:33:08.754189", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}

No worries, you decide with whom you share visibility; otherwise, they will just be visible to users of your company.\n\n![Add new transports](The image appears to be a fleet management dashboard, specifically a \"Fleet Monitor\" that displays the scheduling and tracking of various vehicles over a period from June 20 to June 24. \n\nKey features include:\n\n1. **Date Range**: A timeline indicated for each day with time slots, segmented by hours.\n\n2. **Vehicle List**: A sidebar showing a list of assets or vehicles, including their names and associated individuals (e.g., JW5969G-V, TD99Y160).\n\n3. **Color Coding**: Blocks of colors (mostly green, red, and some yellow) representing different statuses or categories of transport tasks, like scheduled deliveries or completed tasks.\n\n4. **Transport Details**: Within the timeline, details about each transport, including product names (e.g., \"NESTLE,\" \"COCACOLA\"), unique identification numbers, and designations (like D-12, FR-10).\n\n5. **Alerts**: Certain tasks appear to have alerts or flags for attention (indicated by red colors and exclamation marks).\n\nOverall, the interface seems designed for logistics management, allowing users to track asset utilization and scheduled tasks efficiently.)\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 **Create your first transport for a truck and allocate it**\n\n1. Choose '**+schedule**' next to the vehicle that should carry out the transport.\n2. The allocation side bar opens on your right. Below the search bar, you see a blue '**create new transport**' button. Click this button to create a new transport and to track it in real-time.\n3. Fill in the required fields of the transport creation form (specify the transport identifier (e.g. transport number), enter the exact loading/unloading address).\n4. Check if all entries are correct, then click '**create transport**'.\n5. Confirm the executing truck by choosing '**allocate**' on the bottom right.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Share your transport status\n\n\u2728 Transports you received via the Visibility Hub platform and were not added by you will be shared with your customer (= the creator of the transport) automatically upon vehicle allocation. However, the transports you have newly created are only visible to you by default. You decide if you want to share the status information + truck position and with whom.\n\n![Share your transport status](The image appears to be a screenshot from a fleet monitoring software interface. It shows a timeline view of connected vehicles, highlighting their statuses, transport details, and a map indicating their locations.\n\n1. **Fleet Monitor Section**:\n   - There is a timeline displaying vehicle activities over several days.\n   - Specific vehicles and their information, such as license plates and current statuses, are listed.\n\n2. **Transport Details**:\n   - The transport number and its details are presented, including origin and destination addresses, status, and other relevant information.\n   - A specific vehicle (license plate 13NT525) is noted to be in a \"working\" status and is linked to shipments from \"Berlin Beverages.\"\n\n3. **Map View**:\n   - A map is displayed on the right side, tracking the vehicle's route.\n   - Distance and estimated time of arrival for the next stop are provided.\n\n4. **Status Notifications**:\n   - There are indications about delays, with one delivery being 49 minutes delayed.\n   - Options for sharing status updates are also shown.\n\nThis interface is likely designed for logistics management, allowing users to monitor the location, status, and progress of their fleet in real-time.)\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd27 **Share your first transport status**\n\n1. Click on the transport in the fleet monitor view which you would like to share (= one of the red/green boxes).\n2. The transport view opens on the right. Click the '**more details**' button on the upper right of the side panel.\n3. You are guided to the extended detail view in the transport section of Visibility Hub. Here you can decide to share the details of the transport as soon as the truck is 'en route'. Click on '**share status**'.\n4. **Confirm** the generation of a shareable link unique to this transport.\n5. Share the link with any external party (e.g. customer) and they can access ETA and truck location via Visibility Hub Customer Portal.\n\n**Visibility Hub customer portal view:**\n\n![Visibility Hub customer portal view](The image displays a delivery tracking interface. It includes a map showing a location labeled \"Marmolejo Metro Hub\" in Spain. The map indicates the truck's current position about 250 km from the destination. The delivery is managed by \"Berlin Beverages,\" and the truck's license plate is noted as \"1JNT525.\" The delivery status shows it is delayed by 2 minutes, with an estimated time of arrival (ETA) at 15:27. The interface is updated 13 minutes prior. There is also a visual element of a bridge in the background, possibly related to the delivery context.)\n\n---\n\n### References\n- [Take the product tour](https://app.sixfold.com/companies/1/fleet?product_tour_id=300075): Link to the product tour.\n- [Watch the intro video](https://app.sixfold.com/companies/1/fleet?product_tour_id=274028): Link to the intro video.\n- [dispatching group](#): Link to more information on dispatching groups.\n- [add new transports](#): Link to instructions on adding new transports.", "title": "Transporeon Visibility Hub  Fleet Monitor", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5537225-transporeon-visibility-hub-fleet-monitor", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T13:34:10.564578", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}
{"id": "5469197", "content": "### Title  \nWhat is the allocation rate?\n\nThe allocation rate shows how many transports of a given carrier had a license plate assigned compared to the overall number of transports. This rate is always calculated for a certain timeframe and like all visibility metrics, it should be as close to 100% as possible.\n\n### How is it calculated?  \nFor a given time range, Visibility Hub takes all the transports assigned to a carrier and checks how many of these transports do not have a license plate allocated. This value, which is shown in the Transport Network in the Unallocated column, is used in the following formula: *1 - (Unallocated transports / Total transports) = Allocation rate*\n\nExample: Carrier A has 14 transports this week. For 2 of these, no license plates were allocated. 1 minus the result of 2 divided by 14 is 0,86. Which is an allocation rate of 86%. If the carrier would now allocate license plates to the last two transports, the allocation rate will be 100%.\n\n### Why is it important?  \nTransports without a license plate cannot be tracked by Visibility Hub. And without tracking, Visibility Hub receives no real-time visibility data which means we cannot predict when a transport will arrive for loading or unloading. Shippers rely on this information to prepare their facilities for loading and they share this information with customers to let them know when their goods will arrive. \n\n### How can it be improved?  \nFor carrier this is relatively simple and all that needs to be done is to always allocate license plates to transports. It does not take much time but it has a huge impact on the operations of shippers and customers. Please see this [detailed guide on how to allocate transports as a carrier](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4359214-how-to-allocate-a-truck-license-plate).\n\nFor shippers, we recommend monitoring the progress carriers make over time with regards to the allocation rate. If they see that a carrier is now allocating less transports than before (lower allocation rate shown in Transport Network), please reach out to the carrier and discuss the reason for the lower rate.\n\n### References  \n- [detailed guide on how to allocate transports as a carrier](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4359214-how-to-allocate-a-truck-license-plate)", "title": "Allocation rate", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5469197-allocation-rate", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T13:34:14.669270", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}

{"id": "5162652", "content": "### Title\nDiscovering the Transport detail view\n\nFor **cancelled transports**, Visibility Hub offers all carriers **a separate view** not only displaying the actual tracked transport but also showing an additional **purple line**.  \n\nThis purple line maps the GPS data that Visibility Hub received from the allocated vehicle for this transport. With this feature, we want to facilitate the trouble shooting of cancelled transports.  \n\nThe article below focuses on a specific part of cancelled transports which is related to **incorrect master data underlying the transport**. It will describe: \n\n1. **Prerequisites for successful transport tracking.**\n2. **Detecting loading and unloading locations.**\n3. **Good to know**\n\n---\n\n**1. Prerequisites for successful transport tracking**\n\n1. A license plate is allocated to the transport.  \n   *(Learn here how to allocate)[https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4359214-how-to-allocate-a-truck-license-plate]*\n\n2.

The truck enters all (un-)loading locations of the transport so its arrival can be detected and visibility can be switched on and off.\n\n4. The itinerary of the transport matches the itinerary of the allocated truck or at least the stops specified in the tour are visited in any order.\n\nThe error message: The truck route did not match the itinerary, relates to points 3. and 4. which will be described in more detail below.\n\n---\n\n**2. Detecting loading and unloading locations**\n\nAround each loading and unloading location there is a set of GPS coordinates that is associated with this location. Visibility Hub's smart algorithm can detect based on the GPS signal of the truck if such a location is physically entered. That will trigger switching visibility on (=starting a tour) or off (=ending a transport).\n\nIn reality, there are two major problems that can occur if the loading or unloading of a truck cannot be detected:\n\n1. A **wrong truck was allocated** to the transport (= the truck never entered the (un-)loading location.  \n   \u261d**To check** if that happened, open transport details and investigate if the truck took the route as expected and if the purple line entered all loading and unloading locations.  \n   \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude92**To avoid** this in the future, make sure the correct trucks are allocated to the transports.\n\n2. The **truck did not send any GPS signal** at the (un-)loading location.  \n   \u261d**To check** if that happened, open transport details and investigate if there are parts of the route that are not covered by a purple line (= there was no option to detect loading or unloading).  \n   \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude92**To avoid** this in the future, report this issue to your GPS provider and ask for a log file that proves that the GPS data has been transmitted. With this document, reach out to [Transporeon Support](https://support.transporeon.com) and have this problem investigated.\n\n---\n\n**3. Good to know**\n\nIn practice, we know that there can be many reasons why a truck is driving the route not in accordance with the transport plan. In Visibility Hub, we take this into consideration as long as the truck visits the stops that are specified in the transport. Even if the truck services the stops in a different order, the transport will still be tracked.  \n\nHowever, if the truck is too far away from any of the stops it is planned to visit, Visibility Hub will notify with the warning above to protect the privacy of your data.\n\nPlease note, the better Visibility Hub knows in which order the truck visits loading and unloading stops, the more accurate the calculated ETA in real time will be. If you see problems here, please reach out to your shipper and discuss together how the target of correct transports in the system can be achieved.\n\n---\n\n### References\n- Learn here how to allocate: [https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4359214-how-to-allocate-a-truck-license-plate](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4359214-how-to-allocate-a-truck-license-plate)  \n- Learn more about vehicle management: [https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4657633-sixfold-vehicle-management-tool](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4657633-sixfold-vehicle-management-tool)  \n- Transporeon Support: [https://support.transporeon.com](https://support.transporeon.com)", "title": "Warning: Unexpected truck behavior", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5162652-warning-unexpected-truck-behavior", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T13:34:29.759273", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}
{"id": "5141793", "content": "### Title  \nUnderstanding the Visibility Index and Its Improvement\n\nAre you looking for a general explanation of the Visibility index and how it can be improved? Have a look at [this article in our help centre](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4384183-visibility-index).\n\nThe allocation rate and visibility index are the two most important indicators of how much visibility data a carrier is sending to Visibility Hub. The higher both values are, the better. The progress shown for each of these values tells you how much the carrier has improved or declined over a certain timeframe.\n\nTo calculate the progress, Visibility Hub first calculates the allocation rate and visibility index of the **current period**. E.g. when you choose the start time \"This week\", Visibility Hub calculates the allocation rate and visibility index by looking at all transports that started this week. You can change the start time by choosing a different Start time filter value from the Filter dropdown in the Visibility view of the Transport Network.\n\nNext, Visibility Hub calculates the allocation rate and visibility index of the **previous period**. The previous period is automatically chosen based on the current period. E.g. if the start time chosen is \"This week\" then Visibility Hub will look at all transports from last week to calculate the visibility index and allocation rate. If you choose \"Last week\" as start time, then the previous period will be the week before that. If you choose \"Last 30 days\", then Visibility Hub picks the previous month as period.\n\nOnce the values of both periods are calculated, we use a simple **subtraction** to calculate the **progress**: current_value - previous_value = progress. E.g. the start time is \"This week\" with a current allocation rate of 50% and a current visibility index of 35%. The previous week, the allocation rate was 56% and the visibility index was 30%.\n\nAllocation rate progress: 50% - 56% = -6  \nVisibility index progress: 35% - 30% = +5  \n\nYou can also choose \"Specific dates\" as current time period. Visibility Hub will use the exact same duration as previous period. E.g. you choose the 10 first days in May 2021 as current time period. So Visibility Hub will use the last 10 days of April 2021 as previous period for the progress calculation.\n\n### References  \n- [this article in our help centre](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4384183-visibility-index): Explanation of the Visibility index and how to improve it.", "title": "How allocation and visibility progress is calculated", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5141793-how-allocation-and-visibility-progress-is-calculated", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T13:34:35.642490", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}
{"id": "5052924", "content": "### Title\nCreating Places in Visibility Hub\n\nWe strongly recommend creating your own places in Visibility Hub when you want to\n\n- Monitor incoming transports and trucks at-site of specific locations\n- Adjust the geofence of a location where the tracking fails\n- Add more location related filter options\n\nPlease note that you need to have the Admin role in Visibility Hub to create, edit and remove a place. ([Find out if you have an admin role](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/8473503-user-roles-in-visibility-hub))\n\nThe following steps explain how to create a place in Visibility Hub.\n\n1. Go to the Places view and click the \"+\" button next to the search bar.  \n   ![Step 1](The image appears to show a user interface, likely from a mapping or location-based application. On the left side, there's a vertical list labeled \"Places\" with several entries, including names of locations along with their addresses in various countries (e.g., Amazon BCN2, Amsterdam, BB Fabric Berlin). At the top of the list, there is a search bar labeled \"Search for a place by place name,\" and next to it, a yellow plus sign button which seems to allow users to add a new place. On the right side, there's a faded map showing part of Europe, including islands like Ireland. The overall design has a clean and organized layout for navigating places.)\n\n2. You will now see a map with all transport addresses that Visibility Hub has received from you. Each address represents either a loading or unloading stop from a previous transport. Addresses marked with a blue dot are already connected to a place.\n   ![Step 2](The image depicts a user interface for selecting an address, likely from a mapping or geographic information system. On the left side, there is a list of addresses in a vertical format, each followed by an arrow indicating more options. The selected address is \"Am Fuchsberg 5, 12529, Sch\u00f6nefeld, DE,\" which is highlighted and is shown to be connected to \"BB Fabric Berlin.\"\n\nOn the right side, there is a map of Europe, showing various locations marked with black dots, possibly indicating points of interest or addresses. The map extends from the UK in the west to portions of northern Europe, including parts of Scandinavia, and down through central and southern Europe, including Italy and parts of Spain. The background of the map is light blue, indicating water bodies.)\n\n3. Select the address for which you want to create a place from either the map, the scrollable list or via the search bar. Click on that address and the Place creation view opens.\n   ![Step 3](The image appears to show a user interface for creating a new geolocation entry, possibly within a mapping or tracking application. \n\n- On the left side, there are fields for entering a name for the location (\"Tartu\") and defining a geofence shape (options for \"Circular\" or \"Custom\").\n- Below that section, there is a prompt to select linked addresses that improve tracking quality. One address is pre-selected (Anne 47, 50606, Tartu, EE), with a potential alias listed beneath it.\n- On the right side, a map displays the city of Tartu, with a circular geofence highlighted, indicating the area to be covered. The map shows various streets and points of interest, including \"Tartu University Hospital\" and \"Tamme Stadium,\" along with a scale indicating a radius of 2000 meters. \n\nAt the bottom, there are buttons for \"Cancel\" and \"Create place.\" The design suggests it might be a part of a localization service or application for tracking or managing locations.)\n\n4. Here you can enter the name of the new place, add potential aliases (duplicate or very close-by addresses) and, most importantly, adjust the geofence by moving the pin on the map to the correct location where your trucks will be arriving or passing through. This ensures the correct tracking of all incoming traffic.\n   ![Step 4](The image appears to be a user interface for creating a new location on a mapping platform. It includes several sections:\n\n1. **Set a Name**: A field labeled \"Set a name\" where the name \"Tartu\" is entered.\n2. **Define Geofence**: An area where users can choose the shape and size of the geofence. Two options are provided: \"Circular\" and \"Custom.\"\n3. **Select Linked Addresses**: A section for selecting addresses linked to the location, with \"Anne 47, 50606, Tartu, EE\" checked, and a possible alias \"Jaama 173, 50705, Tartu, EE\" listed.\n4. **Map Display**: On the right, a map shows the location of Tartu, along with a circular geofence area outlined in yellow. Several features, like rivers and roads, can be seen on the map.\n5. **Action Buttons**: At the bottom, there are \"Cancel\" and \"Create place\" buttons.\n\nOverall, the interface is designed for users to define a location and its geofencing parameters efficiently.)\n\n5. Once you click the \"Create place\" button, your new place will be added. The screen then changes to the warehouse view of this place and sooner or later you should see the first trucks approaching your place.\n   ![Step 5](The image displays a user interface, likely from a logistics or delivery management application. On the left side, there is a list of places, including various Amazon warehouses and cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin, and Moscow. The selected location is \"Tartu,\" highlighted in yellow, with its address listed as \"Anne 47, 50606, Tartu, EE.\"\n\nOn the right side, there is a section labeled \"Approaching,\" which indicates that there are currently no shipments approaching the site, presenting an icon of a box and a message stating \"No transports approaching site.\" Additionally, there are options to view \"At site\" status, but it is not detailed in this section. The overall layout is clean and organized for tracking locations and transport statuses.)\n\n### References\n- [Find out if you have an admin role](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/8473503-user-roles-in-visibility-hub)", "title": "Create a new place", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5052924-create-a-new-place", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T13:34:49.254598", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}
{"id": "5028904", "content": "### Title  \nBackground information about subcarrier management\n\nIf you are contracted by one of your **customers (main carrier)** to execute a transport for another party, on Visibility Hub we call it 'being a subcarrier'.\n\nIn order to provide the end customer with real time visibility for the transports, it is crucial that :\n- your fleet is connected on Visibility Hub (via a connection to your telematics provider) (see how to do that [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-uberblick-uber-anbindungsmoglichkeiten))\n- you 'enable' the visibility of a transport by 'allocating' a license plate to the transport (see how to do that [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4359214-wie-weise-ich-ein-kennzeichen-zu))\n\nAs Subcarrier you do not see the customer's transports automatically. The reason is that in many cases, main carriers do the 'allocation' of a license plate for their subcarriers. That is why we also give them the option to select your license plate during the allocation process for their customer's transports. This is what we call 'granting vehicles'.\n\n### What does this 'granting vehicle' function do ?\nIt gives the main carrier the possibility to allocate your license plates for you. However, this alone will not make your truck visible to the end customer. We detect when the truck of a particular transport drives to the loading place. Only then, will we switch real time visibility on and only during the duration of this specific transport.\n\n### What does the 'sharing vehicle location' function do ?\nYou can decide if the main carrier is allowed to see your whole fleet or only some vehicles 24/7. For example, in order to figure out the next best transport to give to you.\n\nYou are free to choose if this functionality is valuable for your partnership.\n\n**Important :** If you decide to share your vehicle positions with one of your partners or more, these locations will not be shared with anyone else. Shippers will continue to see vehicle locations only from loading to unloading point of a transport and only if a truck license plate has been allocated to it.\n\nThis functionality can easily be enabled in our [vehicle management tool](https://app.sixfold.com/companies/1/vehicle-management) :\n\n### References  \n1.

General concept of tracking and vehicle management \n\n**In order to provide real-time visibility (RTV) data on transports** you need to connect trackable assets to Transporeon Visibility Hub. The Visibility Hub is asset agnostic meaning an asset can be a trailer, a tractor, a mobile phone, or any other device. The only requirement is that the asset has to be **trackable**, meaning sending position updates during transports.\n\nAll assets in the Visibility Hub are called **vehicles**, and once **connected** they can be **allocated** to transports or **permanently shared** with your partners.\n\n### Connecting your vehicles\n\nIn order to connect your **own vehicles** for transport execution, you need to integrate a **data source** to Visibility Hub. The easiest, fastest, and most common way of connecting your vehicles is via a direct connection to your GPS (telematics system) provider but we also support several alternatives. Read more on [how to connect vehicles](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-overview-connection-possibilities).\n\nAfter adding the data source(s), the vehicles coming from these integrations will be connected to the Visibility Hub platform, displayed in your Vehicle Management view and are **ready for allocation and tracking.**\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1) **Give Visibility Hub access to your fleet**  \nIn order to be sure that your current and future vehicles are available for tracking, we recommend **giving Visibility Hub permanent access to your entire fleet**. Our data engine only shares your data when the data sharing criteria is fulfilled (right vehicle at the right time and place for the specific customer). Data coming from vehicles not used for tracking will be discarded until the day you choose to share data.\n\n2) **Let Visibility Hub manage the data of your fleet**  \nSave time and stay competitive by trusting Visibility Hub to manage the data of your fleet. You do not have to worry about adding/removing vehicles or switching on/off the data sharing, we will tell you if any actions are needed from your side.\n\n3) **Grow and maintain a healthy fleet**  \nWhen you follow our recommendations mentioned above all your vehicles should send frequent position updates to Visibility Hub. We call such vehicles \u201c**healthy vehicles**\u201d that are ready for tracking.\n\n4) **Check the status of the vehicles frequently**  \n**Active vehicle** \u2013 Visibility Hub has received a GPS position update within the last 96 hours.  \n**Inactive vehicle** \u2013 Visibility Hub has **not received** a position update within the last 96 hours. \n\nIf the \u201cinactive\u201d vehicle is **from your own fleet**, check the status of the integration in the \u201cIntegrations\u201d tab on Visibility Hub and follow the instructions. In case of no instructions, please reach out to your GPS provider for support. Alternatively, reach out to [Transporeon support](https://support.transporeon.com/).\n\nIf the \u201cinactive\u201d vehicle **is not your own**, let your partner know and ask them to reach out to fix the issue with their GPS provider.\n\n**Please note!** The statuses are not related to any transports, meaning they only indicate the \u201chealth\u201d of the vehicle and the connection to Visibility Hub.\n\n5) **Grow your vehicle network**  \nMake sure all the vehicles you use for existing and future customers are connected to Visibility Hub. If new vehicles are added to your fleet or you start working with a new subcontractor, make sure to connect them. Use the \u201cConnect vehicles\u201d button in Vehicle Management for that.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Functionalities of the vehicle management feature\n\n### 1) Integrations tab - Adding GPS (telematics system) integration\n\nThis feature enables you to connect the vehicles you use for your own and/or for customers\u2019 transports. Add a GPS (telematics system) integration and get ready to start your real-time visibility journey.\n\nClick the Integrations tab. Find the GPS provider(s) you use by searching them from the list and follow the few steps in the simple integration. Click [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5940902-connecting-gps-adding-vehicles) to read more about how to add/connect vehicles.\n\nThe synchronisation with your GPS provider will start after the required information is provided and can take up to 24 hours. \n\nIf your provider is not in the list, simply click on the \u201cAdd your missing provider\u201d link, submit their contact details and we\u2019ll reach out to start the integration. We will keep you informed during the integration process. \n\nYou can see the status of the integration in the Integration tab.\n\nOnce your vehicles are **connected** to Visibility Hub you are able to see the vehicles of each integration by clicking the \u201cView vehicles\u201d link.\n\n**What do the columns show?**\n\n- **Name:** The name of the data source / integration \n- **Updated:** The time of the last integration update in Visibility Hub\n- **Status:**\n    - **In development** \u2013 the integration is in progress.\n    - **In review** \u2013 The integration is not working for some reason.\n    - **Active** \u2013 The integration is **enabled in Visibility Hub**. \n        Please note! Integration enabled status does not automatically mean that your vehicles are sending data to the Visibility Hub. Check the status of the vehicles (active/inactive) in the Dedicated Vehicles tab.\n    - **Inactive** \u2013 The integration is **disabled in Visibility Hub**. \n        This could mean that the integration was never enabled due to wrong credentials or that an enabled integration has been disabled for some reason.\n    - **Update credentials** \u2013 The credentials of the integration are either invalid or have expired. Once you have updated the credentials the integration will become active again.\n\n**View Vehicles:** Displays the list of vehicles from the specific integration. All the vehicles are also shown in the **Dedicated Vehicles** tab.\n\nHint: Read more about [different ways to connect](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-overview-connection-possibilities) to Visibility Hub.\n\n### 2) Dedicated Vehicles tab\n\nThis tab gives you a simple table and map view of all your dedicated vehicles. These are your own vehicles and the vehicles your partners have dedicated you 24/7 visibility.\n\n**What do the columns show?**\n\n- **License plate:** The license plates of the vehicles that are at your disposal 24/7 (your own vehicles and the vehicles your partners have dedicated to you). You can allocate them for transports, see them on the map view, and dedicate your own vehicles to a partner you work for.\n- **Integrations:** The name/type of the integration the license plate is coming from. If the license plate is available through multiple integrations the text \u201cIntegrations (number of integrations)\u201d is displayed. Clicking on the text opens the side panel where you can see all the integrations.\n- **Dedicated by:** The name of your partner (typically a subcontractor) who has dedicated some or all of their vehicles to you. The vehicles will stay in the list until your partner decides to take them back.\n- **Dedicated to:** The name of your partner (typically a freight forwarder) to whom you have dedicated a vehicle. If more than one partner has full access to the vehicle the text \u201cDedicated Partners (number of partners)\u201d is displayed. Clicking on the text opens the side panel where you can see all the partners who have 24/7 visibility.\n- **Last signal:** The time when the **last (GPS) position update was received in Visibility Hub**. We use this to indicate the \u201chealth of your vehicles\u201d in Visibility Hub.\n\n**Statuses:**\n\n- **Active** \u2013 Visibility Hub has received a position update **within the last 96 hours**. \nWe indicate that the vehicle is \u201chealthy\u201d and would most likely be trackable on the next transport if the data sharing criteria is met (right vehicle at the right time and place).\n- **Inactive** \u2013 Visibility Hub has **not** received a position update within the last 96 hours. We indicate that the vehicle/integration needs attention as it will most likely **not be trackable** if allocated to a transport.  \nRead the \u201cRecommendation\u201d above for guidance on how to handle inactive vehicles.\n\n**Vehicle details side panel**  \nClick on a vehicle to open the side panel for more details about the vehicle. This can be valuable for investigating reasons why the transports can\u2019t be tracked etc.\n\nThe \u201cVehicles\u201d and \u201cStatus\u201d filters let you filter out your own or partner vehicles by different statuses.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nBe **proactive** and pay attention to the inactive vehicles in your list and make sure they send regular data to Visibility Hub before the vehicles are allocated to a transport.\n\nClick on the \u201cMap\u201d to see the vehicles on the map view. The dots will show the position of the vehicles based on their last GPS location update to Visibility Hub.\n\n**Dots on the map**\n\n- **Green** \u2013 the status of the vehicle is active\n- **Grey** \u2013 the status of the vehicle is inactive\n\n**Note!** There are no dots for inactive vehicles that have never sent a GPS position update to Visibility Hub.\n\n### 3) Dedicated by partners tab\n\nThis tab gives you a list of all the partners working for you (typically your subcontractors) and an overview of the vehicles they have dedicated to you 24/7.\n\nClick on the name of the partner to see the vehicles dedicated to you. You can see the vehicles in the table or map view.\n\nIf some vehicles are missing from the list, ask your partner to make them visible for you.\n\n**Please note!**  \nPer default integrated vehicles are only visible to the vehicle owner. This means that you will not see your partners\u2019 vehicles in the vehicle management unless they have been dedicated to you. Your partners can only dedicate **their own vehicles** and not the vehicles that are permanently shared with them by one of their partners. \n\n**Hint!**  \nTo find out if your subcontractor\u2019s vehicle is connected and **available** for tracking use one of Visibility Hub\u2019s allocation dialogues and check if the license plate used on transport is connected and available to you via your partner.\n\n**Allocation dialogue**\n\n1. Open the \"Unallocated\u201d tab in your Transport view\n2. Click the \u201c+Allocate\u201d\n3. Enter the license plate number you want to check\n\nIf the vehicle is available for you it will show via the drop-down list. If the license plate is not shown, reach out to your subcontractor and ask them to connect the license plate to you.\n\n### 4. Dedicate your vehicles tab\n\nThe vehicles you have connected to Visibility Hub via an integration are only visible to you by default.\n\nWhen executing transports for other carriers (you are a subcontractor to them) it is possible to allow them to see your vehicles as well - also when the vehicles are not allocated to a transport. By allowing your partners permanent visibility to your vehicles this can help them make better and faster decisions when allocating transports to your vehicles.\n\nYou can **only dedicate your own vehicles** to your partners.\n\nThe \u201cDedicate your vehicles\u201d tab shows you the list of all the partners you are working for (you are a subcontractor to them), and you can see the list of vehicles you have dedicated to them.\n\nClick on the name of the partner to see the list of vehicles you have already dedicated (marked yellow) and the vehicles still available for sharing with the partner (not marked).\n\n**Note!** If some of the not yet dedicated vehicles are permanently shared with other partners, the name of the partner will show in the \u201cdedicated to\u201d column.\n\nAs you own the vehicles you decide how many partners will have 24/7 visibility. Be aware that all the partners will be able to follow the vehicle, and the driver, until you \u201ctake back\u201d the vehicle.\n\n**Please note!**  \nYou do not have to dedicate vehicles that are only used for transports. Your customers will see the location and receive the GPS updates from your vehicles during the transports.\n\n**Best practice!**\n\n- Due to privacy concerns we advise only to dedicate a vehicle to one partner at a time.\n- Do not dedicate vehicles only used for transports.\n- Inform your partners when you have dedicated or taken back the dedicated vehicles. \n- Make sure all the dedicated vehicles are \u201cactive\u201d.

{"id": "4384183", "content": "### Title\nRequirements for the Visibility Index\n\nThe Visibility Index sheds light on the quality of real-time visibility tracking on transport level. The index is a percentage scoring from 0 to 100 based on objective criteria and updates in real-time. A value of 50% indicates that only half of the transport was tracked in real-time.\n\nThe index consists of several components that we call \u201cvisibility problems/issues\u201d (more details below). Its value is calculated at the time of completion or cancellation of a transport. Each transport can therefore have a unique visibility problem (or lack thereof). If there are several problems, the problem with the highest influence is displayed in the Visibility Hub Tour Details or Transport Network Report.\n\nOverall, there are three variables influencing the value of the visibility index.\n\n\ud83d\udca5= marks the underlying problem  \n\ud83d\udc99 = marks the way to tackle the problem  \n\n## 1. The vehicle is unknown to Visibility Hub or does not send any GPS updates.\n- \ud83d\udca5 In Visibility Hub there is a strict rule: no license plate allocated = no truck will be made visible because the license plate allocation is the consent of the data owner to track the transport.\n- \ud83d\udca5 With no license plate allocated, no visibility can be provided and the Visibility index will be 0.\n- \ud83d\udc99 Increase your visibility index to 100% by allocating all your transports. Click here if you need to connect an [additional GPS Provider](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4356595-connecting-a-gps-provider) or a subcarrier to have all license plates available.\n\n## 2. The vehicle is allocated late or the GPS signal is provided after the start of the transport.\n- \ud83d\udca5 Real-time tracking of the whole transport is not possible as GPS signals only reach us after the transport has already started.\n- \ud83d\udca5 One example: If the allocation was done 3 hours after the start of the tour and the duration of the tour is 10 hours, the visibility index will be 70% (your customer cannot track the transport during the first 3 hours - 30% of the tour).\n- \ud83d\udca5 The same logic applies to GPS signals that are not provided at tour start.\n- \ud83d\udc99 To increase your visibility index for allocated tours to 100%, make sure your vehicles are allocated **before** the start of the transport.\n\n## 3. The GPS signal provided is provided infrequently\n- \ud83d\udca5 What is infrequent?: Visibility Hub requires 1 GPS point per 10 KM at least.\n- \ud83d\udca5 If GPS signals are received less frequently, the visibility index will be reduced accordingly. It can also happen that GPS signal quality is bad only for parts of the tour. Of course, this is also accounted for in the Visibility Index.\n- \ud83d\udc99 To dig deeper into your individual problem please visit our tour detail view. Here you have the possibility to see on which parts of the tour the GPS signal was not sent properly. The best is usually to contact your GPS provider directly to ask them to solve the issue (log files can be downloaded from the tour details).\n\n## Why is this feature valuable?\nAs a real-time visibility provider, Visibility Hub strives to provide as much REAL-time visibility as possible. It's not enough to simply track to completion, but to provide seamless and issue-free tracking on the route. The better visibility you can provide to your customers, the better they can also prepare for your arrival and the faster you are back on the road.\n\n### References\n- [Additional GPS Provider](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4356595-connecting-a-gps-provider) - Connecting an additional GPS provider or subcarrier.", "title": "Visibility Index", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4384183-visibility-index", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T13:35:47.784517", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}

The user is advised to contact the carrier after reasonable time to find out why the invite has not yet been accepted. Users can re-send the invite to the carrier, in order for the carrier to start the onboarding process.\n- **Registered** - The carrier has completed the registration in Transporeon, but is not yet connected to Visibility. Here the user is advised to ask the carrier to access Visibility from the Transporeon main page to finalize the onboarding.\n- **In progress** - The carrier is connected to Visibility, but is still in progress of connecting a visibility source. The user should contact the carrier to see if there are any problems if the status is unchanged after a couple of days.\n- **Ready for tracking** - Visibility source is connected, and the carrier is ready to provide real time visibility.\n- **Connected** - Visibility source is connected, and the carrier has/is providing real-time visibility to its customers through Visibility.\n- **Onboarding stuck** - The onboarding of a carrier is not going as expected because something is missing to finish the integration. The reason why the onboarding is stuck can be found in the carrier's side panel details. Here the user is advised to reach out to the carrier to provide the missing information to Visibility. In most cases motivating the carrier often brings the fastest results.\n\n### References  \nNo references were provided in the HTML content.", "title": "Onboarding statuses in Visibility Control Center", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4376177-onboarding-statuses-in-visibility-control-center", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T13:35:56.946495", "product": "Road Visibility", "source": "intercom"}

We provide reliable ETAs by collecting data in real-time from different sources (ocean carriers, satellite-AIS systems, port operators) and automatically detect transshipments and port changes. Through the careful use of historical data and machine-learning models, we turn this data into actionable intelligence that gives you the most accurate view of reality.\n\n**End-to-end supply chain visibility in a unified user interface**\n\nNo more blind spots in your global transports. We help shippers and forwarders become proactive by giving a full overview of every leg of your shipments and inform you before things go wrong. This end-to-end supply chain visibility helps to better manage transports and deliver a higher quality service to the end customers.\n\nThe Ocean Transports Visibility UI can be accessed by clicking on the ferry icon in the menu and it has two main views.\n\n**1. Listing view of all your ocean containers**\n\nGain control over your ocean transports through real-time status updates of all your shipments. The status of the shipment can be **Delayed**, **On time** or **Completed**.\n\nBesides statuses, the listing view also includes data such as container number, booking number, carrier, transshipment locations, and the planned, estimated and actual time of arrival of each container.\n\n![Ocean list view](The image displays a table titled \"Transports,\" which appears to track shipping containers. The columns include:\n\n1. **Container No.**\n2. **Booking No.**\n3. **Bill of Lading No.**\n4. **Carrier**\n5. **Origin**\n6. **Transshipment**\n7. **Destination**\n8. **PTA** (Planned Time of Arrival)\n9. **ETA** (Estimated Time of Arrival)\n10. **ATA** (Actual Time of Arrival)\n11. **Status**\n\nThe table lists multiple entries for container shipments, with most entries indicating a \"Delayed\" status, while one entry is marked as \"Completed.\" The origins and destinations are also specified for each transport, alongside their respective planned and estimated arrival times.)\n\n**2. Detail view of container transports with map view, logs and port events**\n\nThe detail view gives a great overview of where your containers are through real-time vessel location on the map and port events about gate in, loading, unloading, etc.\n\nThe milestone view on the right gives an overview of planned, estimated, and actual time of arrival for different steps during the transportation.\n\nOverall, the detail view helps to identify containers at risk of demurrage and detention charges so you can deal with containers that need immediate attention.\n\n![Ocean map view](The image displays a transport tracking interface that outlines the details of a completed shipping route. \n\n### Key Elements:\n1. **Transport Details**:\n   - Origin: Barcelona (ESBCN)\n   - Destination: Altamira (MXATM)\n   - Status: Completed\n   - Carrier: Wunderbar Transport\n   - Container Number: TCLU1599680\n   - Booking Number: b-265467491\n\n2. **Map**:\n   - A visual route showing the shipping path between Barcelona, Valencia, and Altamira across the North Atlantic Ocean.\n   - The route is represented with a solid green line and markers to indicate locations.\n\n3. **Event List**:\n   - Lists various events related to the transport, each with timestamps indicating when specific actions (like arrival and unloading) took place, including both actual and estimated times.\n\n4. **Timestamp Information**:\n   - The shipment timeline includes different timestamps marked for arrivals and unloadings, acknowledging time in UTC.\n\nOverall, the interface provides a clear snapshot of the shipment's journey, key statistics, and operational details.)\n\n![Ocean log view](The image displays a transport details interface, likely from a logistics or shipping platform. \n\n### Key Components:\n- **Transport Information**: \n  - Origin: Barcelona (ESBCN)\n  - Destination: Altamira (MXATM)\n  - Carrier: Wunderbar Transport\n  - Container Number: TCLU1599680\n  - Booking Number: b-265467491\n  - Status: Completed\n\n- **Dates and Times**: Includes tracking information with timestamps for various events, such as truck allocation, tracking start, and arrival at different stops.\n\n- **Events Log**: A list of events detailing the transport's journey, including departures, arrivals, unloading, and loading, with specific timestamps.\n\n- **Map and Events Tabs**: Indicate options for visual presentation of transport routes and detailed event logs. \n\nOverall, the interface provides a comprehensive overview of the logistics process for the specified transport.)\n\n**Benefits of Ocean Visibility**\n\n**Focus on exceptions**\n\nReliable visibility data helps logistics planners to focus on exceptions like delays, transshipments, vessel changes, etc., meaning moving their transport management from reactive to proactive and thereby working with shipments where things are about to go wrong.\n\n**Improve customer satisfaction**\n\nReal-time status updates about vessel changes, transshipments, loading, unloading, etc., and the planned, estimated, and actual time of arrival of each container helps to be on top of things and better manage your ocean transports, thereby providing a higher quality service to your customers.\n\n**Avoid demurrage and detention charges**\n\nDemurrage and detention charges can be costly and create delays when shipping globally. Knowing where your containers are through real-time vessel location and port events about gate in, loading, unloading, etc., helps to timely start your customs clearance activities and on-carriage transportation planning, or identify containers at risk of demurrage and detention, so you can deal with containers that need immediate attention and avoid or reduce the charges.\n\n**Improve your supply chain resilience**\n\nApply mitigation strategies to prepare your supply chain for upcoming changes through early warnings and reliable estimations of deliveries. You\u2019ll be able to adapt in time or organize backup deliveries to mitigate the impact of changes.\n\n**Find and resolve bottlenecks faster**\n\nHigh-quality visibility data helps to identify the actual or potential bottlenecks in your supply chain and replan your logistics to get the goods moving.\n\n### References\n- Ocean Visibility Product: [Transporeon Ocean Visibility](https://www.transporeon.com)\n- Ocean Transports Visibility UI: [Ocean Transports Visibility UI](https://www.transporeon.com/ocean-transports-visibility-ui)\n- High-quality visibility data: [High-quality visibility data](https://www.transporeon.com/high-quality-visibility-data)", "title": "Ocean transports visibility", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6385739-ocean-transports-visibility", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T13:37:14.927444", "product": "Ocean Visibility", "source": "intercom"}

They use TiContract to procure, transfer rates to Rate Management 1, and then use Transport Execution (No Touch orders). They execute approximate 20 rate imports per year, using ~10 templates.  \n\nRate Management 1 is being shut down (end of life) at the end of 2022. RM1 customers are being migrated to RM2. Lenzing has recently worked on migrating and then informed their account manager that they refuse to migrate because of a lack of two features:  \n- Rates cannot be migrated directly from TiContract to RM2 in an automatic way  \n- Mass update, mass edit is not possible in RM2  \n\n## Options  \n- Create TiContract tender formats that include all RM2 data so it can be exported and directly imported to RM2  \n  - One time task to add hidden columns into Lenzig rate cards  \n- Create an import wizard for RM2, and allows it to call the TiContract API to get tender results as a starting point just like Excel upload.  \n- Build a bespoke migration script via XP via customer bundle  \n  - Procurement tribe builds  \n\n## Decisions  \nRate Management 2 (RM2) is an engine for No Touch Order processing, and there are customers that have a strong need have a seamless integration between Freight Procurement to RM2.  \n\n### Assumptions  \nThis is why we invest in a seamless rate transfer between Freight Procurement and RM2  \n- There are contractual commitments to do at least some kind of integration  \n- Regardless of contract, customers appreciate the rate transfer because:  \n  - they don\u2019t want to have organization overhead to hand over data to RM2  \n  - they want to have an upfront validation of data, so later uploads do not fail  \n  - Customers want to get rid of manual work (although the current workload is small)  \n\n### User Stories / Objectives  \n- As a Freight Procurement user I feel like the data passes directly from Freight Procurement to RM2.  \n- As a Freight Procurement user I expect my data to be validated prior to being applied, to ensure higher quality and simplify the transfer.  \n- As a Freight Procurement user I get the required options or guidance in a GUI for self-service, and am not forced to engage consulting or to get extensive training.  \n\n### Out of Scope  \n\ud83d\udca1 Transfer of rates can only happen within the same account, there are no consistent concepts for seamless exchange of data between different customer accounts within TP  \n\nWe will **not** support  \n- consolidation of bid sheets unless they belong to the same bid sheet group \u2192 we strictly work based on a single bid sheet or bid sheet group  \n- consolidation of scenarios  \n- consolidation or separation of multiple lanes \u2192 a row in RM2 will be represented by a single lane in tendering  \n- consolidation or separation of fields in the same lanes  \n- a single transfer can only target a single RM2 table  \n\nTo sum it up: Structure in Tendering must mostly match to rate structure in RM2  \n\n### Expected Workflow  \n- Start with one or multiple allocation within same scenario on Tendering site  \n![Image](The image displays a user interface for a freight procurement system, specifically focused on supplier allocation. It includes a table titled \"suppliers without allocation\" that lists various suppliers along with their details. \n\nKey elements of the layout include:\n\n- **Columns** for supplier names, locations, allocations (in USD), sources, states, and the date an email regarding the allocation was sent.\n- A section for filtering or selecting suppliers.\n- An option to export all allocation files.\n- Specific supplier details with their respective allocations and statuses. For example, several entries show the allocation amount and the corresponding location, such as \"Jakarta.\"\n\nOverall, the interface appears functional and designed to manage supplier data efficiently.)  \n- Select function to transfer data to RM2  \n- Use a wizard to define criteria how data is matched during transfer to RM2 (see criteria below)  \n  - (optional) load predefined criteria as template  \n  - define criteria  \n  - (optional) save criteria to template  \n- (optional) Execute a pre-check of potential transferred data **-> Version 2**  \n  - checks Tendering data against validation rules in RM2 table  \n  - check result (error, or success)  \n  - provide error report  \n- Execute transfer of data to RM2  \n  - do always pre-check again **\u2192 Version 2**  \n  - check result (error, or success)  \n  - provide error report  \n\n### Criteria for transmission  \nThe level below represents the dependencies of data, they do not necessarily represent single steps in UI. UI concept has to be defined separately.  \n\n#### 1st Level  \n**Technical requirement**: RM2 has to provide a list of available RM2 tables via Rest.  \n\nSelect destination table in RM2.  \n\n#### 2nd Level  \n**Technical requirement**: RM2 has to provide all column data about the selected table.  \n\nUser has to map at least all mandatory columns in RM2 table.  \n\nFollowing mapping options are supported  \n- existing column in Tendering  \n- existing value from Tendering Meta Data (start contract, end contract, tender name, bid sheet name, \u2026)  \n- data from carrier (creditor number, name)  \n- constant value (value has to match to column datatype) \u2192 validity  \n\nAs part of the second level, we would also need to apply a filter to the allocated lanes. We cannot assume that the whole allocation goes to the same RM2 table.  \n\nFilter may just support check for equivalency on lane fields  \n\n### Technical requirements for RM2  \nThe following REST endpoints have to be provided by RM2  \n- provide a list of available tables for a given customer number  \n- provide information about all columns in a given table for customer number  \n  - Column names  \n  - Column data type  \n  - mandatory yes/no  \n- Step 2: provide a function to check but not execute a possible import  \n- execute a real rate import (already exists)  \n\n### Carrier Mapping  \nCurrently RM2 supports two different methods to link a rate with a carrier. The method is defined for the whole RM2 table  \n- simple creditor number as text field in rate, that number does not fall under any validation at all  \n- Link to TP carrier database. In that case, the import has to provide a valid creditor number based on TP relation settings  \n\nFor both cases, we definitely need a mapping for Tendering Carrier to TP creditor number (can use existing function of supplier number)  \n\n### Permissions  \nThere are two questions to be clarified  \n- who can trigger such an export towards RM2  \n- should we consider RM2 permissions of the user as well (may be difficult to do)  \n\n### Next Steps  \nFind out what the tender structures of the affected customers look like and what is being done today to convert this structure into the rate structure. The purpose is to find out if the concept solves the customer problem at all - documentation here:  \n\n| Customer | TisysID | Tendering | RM1 | Transport assignment | RM2 | Status |\n|----------|---------|-----------|-----|--------------------|-----|--------|\n| Lenzing | 265005 | yes | yes | yes | no | Communicated RM1 availability by end of 2022.

Bilski)  \n- Possible GoLive RM2 in May  \n- Rate Transfer feature was not escalated by the customer, has more preventive character because RM2 sold with a rate transfer option  \n\n#### Progroup  \n- they use TP Products RTV and Tendering, maybe TA later  \n- RM2 soonest in Q3/Q4  \n- Rate transfer topic was not actively forced by the costumer  \n\n[PD Page](https://api.transporeon.com/hub/)  \n\u2192 final goal is to have the Rate Management API available here  \n\n#### Role model  \n[Visibility API](https://api.transporeon.com/hub/?urls.primaryName=Visibility%20API)  \n- document behavior via swagger  \n- introduce a versioning  \n- document models  \n- Later: finally also implement a sandbox  \n\n#### Implement API Versioning  \n- breaking changes require a new version  \n- old versions need to be supported even with new version  \n- maybe a simple schema of v1, v2 \u2026 is enough  \n- \u2192 task for Julia: check other public known (Rest) APIs how they handle it  \n  - concept of documenting all versions  \n  - or just document the newest version and have a compatibility mapping for older versions  \n\n#### Do we need a shipper parameter  \n- gather shipperID from authorization  \n\n#### New API for configuration  \n- new API to report about the following information  \n  - mandatory  \n    - list of tables  \n    - columns of a table  \n      - name  \n      - title  \n      - datatype  \n      - restrictions (min, max, mandatory)  \n  - goal: should link to all names used in our import/export API  \n  - information about carrier relation  \n\n- optional (later)  \n  - list of quota tables  \n  - quota columns  \n  - report supported features  \n\n### Why are we doing the standardization?  \n#### The main problems:  \n- **a massive amount of hidden information**  \n  from an outside view all current rate data in RM2 is just a bunch of data, its only understandable in customer context  \n- **no possibility to analyze data on a higher level**  \n  mass data can be a valuable source for further conclusions but we cannot provide any additional analyses based on that data  \n  - as a whole for Transporeon (benchmarks, price developments on the market)  \n  - for customers about their own rates (how do rates develop, compare rates to market)  \n- **application of rate to transport data requires (expensive) custom development**  \n  Due to the fact, that data is not understandable in a standard way, any application of these rates to transport requires custom code in scripting. Any change in rate structure requires additional manual work on calculation logic.  \n- **Current system does not scale**  \n  Any new roll-out or structure change of RM2 requires professional services support. No work can be put on customer side, so professional service capacity is a big limitation to scale the usage of RM2. Same problem hinders customer to put more rates on the system.  \n- **knowledge about rates is not in the system**  \n  As data is only understandable by people involved in the definition process of rate setup and their decisions are only depicted in a custom scripting code or in external sources (like customer's own documentation), any later change becomes challenging as implications can be unpredictable  \n\n### Things we should keep in RM2  \n- **stick to the concept of multiple rate tables (rate cards) for data storage**  \n  Customers should still be able to design rate cards according to their needs, not forcing them to a static set of columns or a static way of storing their rates.  \n  But to make it clear: All columns will be standardized to be identifiable  \n  Reason: Otherwise we would force customers to apply a large transformation of their source data before they are able to import it.  \n- **Keep separation of structure plus calculation logic from rate data**  \n  Like now we will be able to roll-out the complete table structure including rate logic as a whole setup to another stage. By that structure and logic can be tested and verified.  \n- **Keep compatibility to existing solution as much as possible**  \n  Due to the large customer base of current RM2 and the high dependency for current transport assignment customers a large migration of data is not realistic and doesn\u2019t make sense.  \n\n### Path to standardization  \n#### Step 1 - Introduce a tagging system  \n- Introduce a system to tag columns in a rate table with additional standardized information about the contents of the table columns (aka meta data).  \n- tagging should allow us understand the data hold in column and cover certain aspects in a standard way  \n  - what is the related data object in the transport process (i.e. departure country)  \n  - clear separation of other related data objects in other columns (no multi-purpose columns)  \n  - standardization of contents (i.e. departure country using two digits ISO code, IATA code for a port)  \n  - standardization of measures (i.e. weight in kilogram)  \n  - standardization of price attributes (base price in **EUR** per **100 kilogram** valid for **2000 - 3000 kilogram**)  \n\n- in general, all methods to enable standardize our data should be used (either by platform standards we already have, existing international standards, or own standards if nothing else can be applied)  \n- The tagging of columns will not replace or disable any existing functionality or change calculation. From that perspective, tagging does not \u201churt\u201d or destroy anything in an initial stage when we use it mainly for analyses (in a later stage, tags will be used for rate calculation as well, then tags may have a more severe impact).  \n\n#### Step 2 - provide standardized data  \n- Standardized columns for operational data [Goal] standardizing how operational rate data is stored and used for price calculation - provide a comprehensive list of standardized columns  \n  - Templated rate tables: [Goal] promote ease of use in onboarding new customers  \n  - Custom columns are allowed **only** for contextual data  \n- Currently, RM2 does not contain any standard data in its database which can be used to validate existing contents. The following data needs to be stored as standard data:  \n  - countries, states  \n  - international codes like IATA\u2026  \n  - currencies  \n  - measures units for weight, volume, length, distances, transport units  \n  - vehicle types, container types  \n  - incoterms  \n\n#### Step 3 - Apply the tagging system  \nThe tagging system is useless if it is not applied to the data. To gain fast value even from existing data we have to tag new and also existing configurations in the same manner.  \n\n#### When do we tag the columns?  \n- For new configurations we will introduce the tagging as mandatory as soon as the implementation is available  \n- For existing configurations we need to enforce tagging as soon modifications are required  \n\n#### How do we tag the columns?  \nIn first considerations we thought about putting tags into our groovy configuration.  \n\nHowever, we then decided to put tags in a separate config for the following reasons  \n- tags are very complex and require a lot of additional data to be added to table definition \u2192 that data would make table definition much more complicated and complex  \n- Groovy config changes follow a process of customer approval and may have an impact on customer processing, tag changes should not have that impact  \n- Sooner or later we need a process to modify tags in UI, If tags are separated from current groovy config that would be much easier   \n\n### Tagging in the UI  \nChanging a config is a quite critical process which may hinder people from applying tags if that is the only way. Therefore we need an alternative to apply tagging in the UI which will not interfere with any changes in the config itself.  \n\n#### Who puts the tags on the columns?  \nFrom the current perspective we see 3 sources of tagging for existing and new data  \n- professional services (PS)  \n  - currently PS is the main source of new table definitions and is also quite aware of what data customer's columns do cover  \n  - for new and modified configurations PS must be enforced to add the necessary tags  \n- Tagging in UI  \n  - we can also allow customers to tag their own data. We are aware that will not happen if we do not offer a significant advantage for customers to do so. Secondly, customer-side tagging needs a higher validation of correctness.  \n  - UI tagging can also be used by other parties on the Transporeon side (non-technical people) to add tags  \n- Automatic tagging based on current column names and column titles  \n  - automatic tagging can be applied using the existing data for some of the columns  \n  - that kind of tagging would require a heavy checking of data contents including strong validation of the result  \n  - requires standard data available in RM2 (step 2)  \n\n### Apply standardized data  \n\ud83d\udca1 The following applications and use cases of standardized rate data need further validation regarding desirability and feasibility  \n\n#### Customer side applications  \n- **Data analyses**  \n  The first use case of standardized data is grouping that data even across multiple rate tables. One of the easiest methods is giving customers collective information about their data, like number of rates in a specific country or number of rates having a specific vehicle type. Furthermore, that information allows time-based analyses using validity columns to show trends and giving forecast data.  \n- **Standardized export and import of data**  \n  Standardized rate data allows a much better exchange with other sources of standardized rates like marketplace.  \n- **Provide a standardized rate calculation**  \n  Having that rate standardization would open the door to provide a standard way of applying rates to transports without any need for custom scripting. In general, we can turn RM2 on the **long term** into a system that can calculate rates without any scripting by using the tagging system plus additional rules to combine tables. It would allow defining the whole setup in the UI.  \n\n#### Transporeon side  \nOn Transporeon side the most attractive result of standard rates would be using rates in RM2 as a base for general analyses of rate development but also benchmark prices (Transporeon Insights) etc.  \n\n### How would that tagging system work?  \n#### Different purposes of columns  \nTo develop a tagging system in a proper way I would like to separate the columns by their purpose. That helps to clarify the different tags and their application.  \n\nThe purpose of columns in a rate table can mainly be separated into three different types  \n- **Filter criteria**  \n  - these columns are used to determine the matching row(s) in a rate table based on data provided as request criteria  \n  - they are mainly checked for equality but could also be checked for greater/less, containment  \n  - these filter criteria can mostly be standardized in a very good manner  \n- **Rates**  \n  - rates (I don\u2019t want to use the term costs as we also sometimes deal with earnings not just spending) indicate an amount of money for transport-related services  \n  - rates very often require additional information within their context and do very often relate to measures or measure units.  \n  - rate columns in a single rate table row are either treated as alternative or additive to get the final transport price  \n- **Additional information**  \n  - information is a collective term to summarize all data in a rate table which is not used for finding the correct row in the table or does not contain data to determine the final price.  \n  - additional information is also very often used to allow differentiation of multiple result lines or sorting them  \n\nIt is not necessary that all of these 3 purposes are present in a rate table or even needed. It is possible to have a rate table that just returns additional information without prices.  \n\nThe basic (and very simplified) process of applying rates to a given transport is acting in the following way  \n- apply some transport data to rate columns that have the filter criteria purpose and find the matching row in the rate table  \n- apply measurements from transport to all applicable rate columns and calculate a sum of them  \n- return the calculated sum including some information from the same row  \n\n### Standardization requirements based on purpose  \nThe reason to separate the purpose is to understand that each of them has different requirements regarding the standardization of data  \n- filter criteria require a high level of standardization as otherwise transport data cannot be applied to different rate tables using the same criteria  \n- rates require a lot of additional attributes to allow an accurate calculation of final prices. As there is a large variation in how rates can be applied in the context of a rate table, there is no possibility to describe a price with a simple name (e.g. \u201cbase price per 1 pallet in the range between 6 and 8 pallets in EUR\u201d versus \u201cdeparture postal code\u201d).  \n- additional information has the lowest level of standardization requirements  \n\n### Column categories  \nFurthermore, I would like to put columns into different categories.  \n\nThe following categories are defined  \n- **Transport locations**  \n  - all data which allows to localize the usage of the rate based on transport relevant data  \n  - typical columns for that category are departure country or departure postal code, but also gates or port codes  \n  - Columns that contain location-related data but are not identifiable outside customer context do not belong to that category (e.g., a plant code)  \n  - transport locations are a typical filter criteria  \n- **Companies**  \n  - all data which contains a reference to any type of company involved in the transport  \n  - typical columns are Carrier creditor numbers or carrier names, but also freight forwarder or port agency  \n  - companies can act as filter criteria but also additional information  \n- **Transport restrictions**  \n  - all data which limits the usage of freight rates in transport-related ways  \n  - typical columns for that category are vehicle types or shipment types  \n  - transport restrictions are typical filter criteria  \n- **Transport measures**  \n  - all data which allows measuring transported goods  \n  - typical columns are minimum weight or number of pallets  \n  - transport measures can be used as filter criteria but also additional attributes in prices where they are treated as filter as well  \n- **Transport rates**  \n  - all data which contains a rate or is directly related to a rate (like a currency column)  \n  - may need 3 sub categories  \n    - base rate (freight costs)  \n    - surcharges (added cost that are known before execution) e.g., fuel  \n    - extra cost (added cost that are not known before execution) e.g., waiting time  \n- **Transport quotas (transport sharing)**  \n  - all data about the distribution of transports like ranking, quotas or capacities  \n  - that data is mostly returned as additional information  \n- **Organizational data**  \n  - all data that is based on customer specific definitions and cannot be standardized in a general way  \n  - typical columns for such data are plant codes, but also any kind of customer-specific references  \n  - organizational data is sometimes used as filter criteria but also as additional information. From a Transporeon point of view, that information is mostly useless in terms of the comparability of rates  \n- **Contextual data**  \n  - all data that is not standardized in any way or cannot be related to any of the categories above  \n  - that data is limited to pure additional information usage  \n\n### Types of tags  \nTagging should be as easy as possible but also as specific as possible. Therefore tagging should take place on different levels using different types of attributes  \n- **Category**  \n  Category as mentioned above is mainly a criteria to give a quick way to find the next level quickly, the above list may still be changed but I think we should not have more than 10 categories as otherwise it loses the quick way to classification.  \n- **Column type** (working title)  \n  The column type determines the usage or the determination of the column. It would many also be the term you would most likely use as a column name. But instead of column names, column types are 100% standardized. A column type can only belong to one category [to be discussed]. The column type determines a lot of the following attributes (if required, their values).  \n  example column types are:  \n  - departure country  \n  - vehicle type  \n  - valid from  \n  - minimum weight  \n- **Data type** (working title)  \n  The data type is an optional attribute to specify the type of data in the column. The available data types depend on the column type and for some column types, there may be no different datatype available. example data types for are  \n  - ISO2 code (for departure country)  \n  - Name in English (for departure country)  \n  - Year (for valid from)  \n  - day (for valid from)  \n\n**Maybe Column type and Data type can also be combined into a single tag (property)**  \n\n- **Unit**  \n  Depending on column type, some (integer and float) columns may need to specify the connected unit to them, that\u2019s often needed for measures used as range values like weights or shipping units, all units need to be standardized, no custom units here  \n- **Measure attributes**  \n  Measures may need additional attributes that allow specifying more details in their usage  \n  Very often measures need some compare attributes like less than or greater than to express ranges (i.e., a column expressing the starting weight of the row or a maximum number of pallets)  \n- **Rate (price) attributes**  \n  Rates (prices) require a lot of attributes because price columns very often bear a lot of implicit information which needs to be covered by attributes. not all of these attributes are always required but they are typical for a lot of use cases  \n  - **Currency**  \n    needed if each price has its own currency, sometimes not needed if currency is specified on row level  \n    Default: Default Currency  \n  - **Calculation attributes**  \n    - **Calculation unit**  \n      Unit which the price is related to, either per shipment (flat rate) or per a unit e.g., per kilogram  \n      Default: shipment  \n    - **Calculation unit amount**  \n      Specifying the amount per which number of calculation units the price is applied  \n      e.g., 100 to tell that price is price is per 100 kilogram  \n      Default: 1  \n    - There may be addition attributes specifying rounding of the final result  \n  - **Range attributes**  \n    Very often prices relate to a specific range (brackets), which has to be applied like a specific filter based on measures  \n    - **Range unit**  \n      the range can have the same unit as used for calculation but it may differ  \n    - **Range from**  \n      bracket start amount e.g., 100 for from 100 kilogram  \n    - **Range to**  \n      bracket end amount e.g., 200 for to 200 kilogram  \n  - **Minimum/Maximum**  \n    Very often rate tables contain a column containing the minimum or maximum price which overrules other price calculations  \n\n#### Work to do \u2026  \nDefine a list of all possible column types including their dependent attributes  \n\n### Validation of concept  \n- Meet with TP Insights Team to define necessary data for Benchmarking  \n  - planned for 11th of May  \n- Key result Q2: Create 5 analyses for 5 customers by simulating the usage of tags for real customer data  \n  - take customer data and check if planned tagging allows us to get the expected results  \n  - Gabriela is checking proper customers now  \n\nThe assignment flow differs between definition in config and UI will differ a lot.  \n\n### Tagging process  \nIn config, the column type has to be set including the dependent attributes. During config validation, we can then indicate possible mismatches between column type and set attributes  \n\n### Tagging in UI  \nIn UI, we need to have a more supportive way of assignment. Here we would need to start with entering the required category and then guide the user through the available column types and their dependent attributes.  \n\n### Technical Implementation  \nThe technical implementation consists of the following parts to be implemented  \n- Storage of a full tag list (column types) including their structure  \n  - application level data to be used as tagging source  \n- Duplicate existing groovy config data to database  \n  - that duplication will allow us to connect existing customer data with configuration  \n- Define ISO standardized data repository for measures and currencies  \n  - that tables are a premature implementation of later standard reference data  \n- Enable connection of tags and column types data with customer rate tables  \n- Later: Enforce usage of tagged columns for new/changed rate tables  \n\n## 1. Tag Repository  \nThe tag repository must be stored in the database. Storage must support multiple levels as tags are multilevel. Tags have the following hierarchy:  \n- \u2192 Category  \n  - \u2192 Column Type  \n    - \u2192 Data Type  \n      - \u2192 Unit  \n      - \u2192 Measure attributes  \n      - potentially a set of additional properties and their data type  \n        - for quota is it a limit or share \u2192 boolean   \n- define a unique ID for each entry  \n  - GUID  \n\nWe need to be able to update that data (not the structure) without the need for a new release. Therefore I recommend using a setting key to be stored in the database (via validation) or having a REST service to set the data.  \n\n## 2. Duplicate Some Groovy Config Data into RM2 tables  \nFor some upcoming steps we should enable the config-related data to be stored in RM2 tables   \n\nThat will allow us to connect real data with config data in the database to extract and analyze data in an easier way  \n\nThe following data must be stored in tables  \n- Step 1  \n  - tables including all properties  \n  - columns including all properties  \n    - information about key fields  \n- Step 2  \n  - lists  \n   \nThere are 2 ways to store the data  \n- using exiting validation function in TPA to immediately store the data after successful validation  \n- have a scheduled task that scans `tab_rm_company_setting` for changes and does it batch-wise  \n\n## 3. Define reference repository for measures and currencies and countries  \nAs basic reference data, we need to support measures and currencies right from the beginning to tag our columns. The implementation of that data is temporary for sure and will be replaced once final reference data is available. Therefore I also prefer an implementation via application setting. Right now I do not see necessity to store the data in the database.  \n\n### Currencies:  \n\n### Measures:  \n\n### Countries:  \n\n## 4. Use tags to automatize calculation as much as possible  \n### Steps:  \n- standardized variables for input  \n  - define standard input parameters for locations and measures (or have a own model for the transport)  \n  - have an internal map between column type and input parameter  \n- Design some high-level DSL functions to use column tags to calculate the final price based on a single table  \n  - e.g. function Get_Price  \n    - Input : (table: string; inputParameters: list of (tag, value))  \n    - output : list of fields, list of price items  \n  - e.g. Get_price(\u2019rates\u2019; (departure_country_from, DE)  \n\n- standardize layout for output mapping  \n\n## Current numbers absolute  \n- 256 customers  \n- 1200 rate tables  \n\n**Rate Pool**  \n- **12 months**: 7.5M rates added  \n- **Lifetime**: 12M rates  \n- **Data volatility**   \n  - **12 months**: 24M actions (add, update, delete) on rates in the last 12 months, so data is constantly modified or deleted  \n  - **Lifetime**: 73M rate actions at all  \n\n### Analysis of data based on column type:  \nMost column identified column types are (based on column name)/ column title:  \n- departure/destination country (with 2 digits code)  \n- valid from/to  \n\n**Rate count live data over all customers**  \n- rates with departure and destination country filled: 5.4 million \u2192 45%  \n- 5 million of those have a validity date \u2192 40%  \n- same ratio can be found in history  \n- **Marketplace standard data concept**  \n  - location (country, postal, code, street, but also, port/airport codes)  \n  - price and currency (Marketplace currently only support FTL)  \n  - all other details are treated as services (vehicle type, restrictions \u2026)  \n\n### Who is changing rates \n- 87000 imports via UI within the last 12 months, 500 of them are by support user (60 different companies)  \n\nThe current approach columns can be identified by the following aspects:  \n- **the column name**  \n  - column names are mainly in English mostly use the customer-specific term for identifying the data  \n  - column names can be very specific (DepartureCountryCode = Country Code of Departure) but also very generic (Country) but also very cryptic (Ctry1)  \n  - there are a lot of terms expressing the most likely the same meaning (origin, from, departure), but they may also represent different ones  \n  - in general the name is not specific enough to identify the contents in a unique way  \n- **the column title**  \n  - the column title is often defined (but mostly more detailed) by the same logic as column name  \n  - it can contain local languages if the customers' user audience is using a common language  \n  - it can contain translation code like #country or #price which provide a higher level of identification  \n  - but again the title is not specific enough to identify the contents in a unique way  \n\nTo standardize data we also need to standardize the types and units of data.  \nThere is also an initiative on Transporeon side to standardize Master and reference data Management:  \n\nThe following data qualifies for standardization on a Transport Execution Tribe level (but even TP wide level). The scope of that data is dedicated to the transportation process and the prices connected to it. It does not cover warehouse management standards apart from pure transportation.  \n- **Countries (sovereign states)**  \n  - **codes**  \n    - ISO alpha 3 (ISO 3166)  \n\n- **additional information**  \n  - name  \n\n**References**  \n- [Countries and territories](https://unece.org/trade/cefact/unlocode-code-list-country-and-territory)  \n- [States (federal states, regions)]  \n  - **codes**  \n    - UN LOCODE as subdivision of countries  \n\n- **additional information**  \n  - country  \n  - name  \n\n- **references**  \n  - [SubdivisionCodes](https://service.unece.org/trade/locode/2022-2%20SubdivisionCodes.htm)  \n\n### Locations  \n- **codes**  \n  - UN LOCODE for more than 100.000 significant places like Rail Terminals, Sea Port, Airports, and Cities  \n  - IATA Codes for Airport  \n\n- **additional information**  \n  - country  \n  - name  \n  - state  \n  - geo-coordinates  \n\n- **references**  \n  - [UNLOCODE-Download](https://unece.org/trade/cefact/UNLOCODE-Download)  \n\n### Currencies  \n- **codes**  \n  - alpha 3 code (ISO 4217)  \n\n- **additional information**  \n  - reference to country  \n  - currency symbol  \n  - decimal places  \n  - name  \n\n- **references**  \n  - [Six Group](https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/financial-information/data-standards.html)  \n\n### Units (unit of measurements)  \n- **categories**  \n  - weight  \n  - volume  \n  - distances/dimensions  \n  - duration  \n  - temperature  \n  - transport-specific units like loading meters or shipments  \n\n- **codes**  \n  - list of \u201cCodes for Units of Measurement used in the International Trade\u201d  \n  - use common code as a general reference (3 alphanumeric digits)  \n\n- **additional information**  \n  - symbol of unit (kg, m, m3)  \n  - name of the unit  \n  - reference unit  \n  - conversion factor towards reference unit  \n  - integers only yes/no  \n\n- **references**  \n  - [UNLOCODE-Download](https://unece.org/trade/cefact/UNLOCODE-Download)  \n\n### Handling units  \n- pallet types  \n- container types  \n- package types  \n- **codes**  \n  - current codes are app specific  \n  - needs a TP wide alignment  \n\n- **additional information**  \n  - dimensions  \n  - measures (weight, \u2026)  \n  - name  \n\n### Vehicle types  \n- **codes**  \n  - current codes are app specific, no standard at all  \n  - requires alignment on a common concept or at least mapping  \n\n- **additional information**  \n  - name  \n  - description  \n\n### Time zones  \n- **codes**  \n  - 3 digit code  \n  - name  \n\n### Cargo type  \n- describes the goods in the cargo  \n- no real standard available  \n- needs a TP wide alignment  \n\n### Attachment types  \n- relevant for TA and TOPS  \n- needs a TP wide alignment  \n- defines the purpose of binary documents attached to transports  \n\n### Incoterms  \n- **codes**  \n  - 3 digits code and name  \n\n### Freight class (US)  \n- needed mainly for US LTL  \n- expressing density and handling of goods  \n\n### ADR classes  \n- **codes**  \n  - ADR classes (UNCode)  \n\n### Emission classes  \n- (needs to be discussed)  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Jonah's feedback: I see many of the categories above (vehicle type, ADR, emissions, etc.) to be **services.** The abstract representation is that there are services that one side **needs** and the other side **provides.** We've found three kinds of services: categorical, numerical, and date-times. Categorical has a category (say trailer type) and allowed values within it (13.6 meter curtainside, 13.6 hardside, etc). In a transaction, we would say one side needs a name + one or more values of a categorical service. The other side provides them. Lastly, the two sides need not have the same reference values that lead to the allowed values. As an example, the buyer may need a **curtainside** trailer. They don't care if it's a jumbo mega or standard height. The carrier may indicate they have a Jumbo trailer. These can match without the two sides having to have selected the same allowed value.  \n\nNumeric services are a range, i.e., min to max of a continuous number vector. Temp min and max are the definitive example.  \n\nDate-time and like numeric services use date-time elements for earliest to latest.  \n\n### Current standard master data in our products  \nThat table gives an overview of how the following products handle standard master data and in case there is a standard, what is the unique key for maintaining the data.  \n\n| Product | Maintained By |\n|---------|---------------|\n| TA (TP Transport Assignment) | Torsten : own analyses |  \n| Tendering (TP Tendering, former TiContract) | Torsten: own analyses, may need further validation |  \n| TOPS (Transport Operations, former Supply Stack) | reviewed with Alex |  \n| TNX (autonomous procurement) | based on review of allowed values API, plus Adrian, may need further validation |  \n| Visibility (Sixfold) | needs still to be evaluated |  \n\n### Reference Data Service  \nBased on evaluation, I recommend the following common system to be stored in a central (tribe or TP wide application service).  \n\nThe global master key is the basic key to uniquely identify an entry; additional global data may be needed to provide additional standardized information that belongs to the key.  \nWe do not intend to support translations out of the reference data service as translations are quite app specific so far.  \n\nSo data (marked with TP Code) will require alignment with the corresponding products.  \n\n### Next steps  \n- Align with Jonah about contents and direction  \n- collect existing master data of all apps to have a common view on data we need to align on (vehicle types, handling units)  \n- decide about implementation strategy  \n\n### Evaluation of current products standardization  \n**TNX (AP)**  \n- maintainable list of standard allowed values separated by market (currently market is indicated by currency)  \n- separated into app-specific categories which are mainly influenced by UI steps  \n- standardized built-in values for  \n  - countries  \n  - currencies  \n  - units of measurement  \n\n**TP TA**  \n- standardized values for countries, currencies, vehicle types, handling units but customer can deviate and even define their own  \n- Countries, currencies, incoterms, states are following international standards  \n\n### Meeting notes in the context of Rate standardization  \n---\n#### 2023-05-11 Usage of RM2 data in Insights  \n**Participants:** Thomas Hang and Christian Dolderer  \n\n**Topics**  \n- General approach of rate standardization explained  \n- exchange about general Benchmarking usage  \n\n**Findings**  \n- Future data could be very useful for insights  \n  - Torsten: RM2 can mainly provide road data (LTL/FTL)  \n  - current Insights data is limited to transport-related data  \n    - analyses of contracted rates are just based on assignment method but there is no or much information even about transport mode like FTL/LTL  \n  - there is an initiative to store more standardized prize information out of rate into transport  \n\n- It's not just the pure rates that are of use; other facts that would be helpful would also be  \n  - the amount of rates which expire soon  \n  - information that can be used to enrich existing benchmark data from transports  \n    - which customers consider diesel/fuel prices in general  \n    - is the transport FTL or LTL  \n\n- any data needs to be provided via data lake   \n\n**Agreed actions**  \n- Thomas and Christian provide a list of data points they would be interested in  \n- As an initial analysis, Torsten provides a list of all customers and their rate table names plus number of rows in it  \n\n| Data type name | Example input | Description |\n|----------------|---------------|-------------|\n| TEXT           | any text      |             |\n| NUMBER         | any number    |             |\n| DATE           | any date      |             |\n| QUOTA_INTERVAL  | week         | One of day, week, month, year |\n| COUNTRY_ISO_3166_1_ALPHA_2 | DE, DK, PL, \u2026 | 2 letter alphanumeric code defined in the country list |\n| STATE_ISO_3166_2_ALPHA_2 | TA (Texas) | 2 letter alphanumeric state/province code |\n| CURRENCY_ISO_4217_ALPHA_3 | EUR | 3 letter alphanumeric code defined in the currency list |\n| WEIGHT_UNECE_ALPHA_3 | KGM (kilogram) | 3 letter alphanumeric code defined in data weight list |\n| LENGTH_UNECE_ALPHA_3 | MTR (meter) | 3 letter alphanumeric code defined in length list |\n| VOLUME_UNECE_ALPHA_3 | MTQ (cubic meter) | 3 letter alphanumeric code defined in volume list |\n| AREA_UNECE_ALPHA_3 | MTK (square meter) | 3 letter alphanumeric code defined in area list |\n| DURATION_UNECE_ALPHA_3 | SEC (second) | 3 letter alphanumeric code defined in duration list |\n| TEMPERATURE_UNECE_ALPHA_3 | CEL (celsius) | 3 letter alphanumeric code defined in temperature list |\n| ANY_MEASURE_UNECE_ALPHA_3 | KGM (kilogram) | any of the 3 letter alphanumeric code defined in any of the measures lists |\n| AIRPORT_IATA_ALPHA_3 | CPH (Copenhagen) | 3 letter alphanumeric airport code |\n| LOCATION_UNLOCODE_ALPHA_5 | US NYC (New York City) | 5 letter alphanumeric UN/LOCODE |\n| INCOTERMS_ALPHA_3 | FAS | 3 letter alphanumeric Incoterms code |\n\n**Standard reference data is saved as CSV in the following application keys**  \n- *rm2ReferenceDataCurrencies*  \n- *rm2ReferenceDataCountries*  \n- *rm2ReferenceDataMeasures*  \n\nThe csv data uses semicolon as a separator and values can both be quoted or not. The csv requires a header line with column names. The order of the header names does not matter, which means the data is parsed not by the column index, but by header name. This should give us the flexibility to change the format more easily. There is a validation url for each key that checks if the csv has a valid structure (all lines have the same number of columns) and that for each key that the expected columns are present and have the correct type (string, number, boolean).  \n\nTP Ratemanagement is undergoing a dramatic change regarding its use cases from a PS/CC (professional services/customer care) managed customer-specific design to a standardized, self-service-driven approach.  \n\n### Current world  \nIn its current usage scenario Rate Management 2 consists of three essential parts  \n1. Customer specific script  \n2. UI to maintain data in rate tables and provide the limited ability to retrieve price calculations based on manual input  \n3. API used by Transport assignment to calculate prices for a given transport  \n\nThe groovy script is the essence of the whole process based on the following aspects  \n- the scripting is based on Groovy language used as a Domain specific language enhanced with a lot of core development to attach rate specific functions  \n- The script is evaluated at run time so changes become immediately effective  \n- there is one single script for each customer maintained in TPA  \n\nThat script covers the following main definitions  \n- **Rate tables** and their columns including table data validation  \n- **Input parameter mapping** from TP Transport based on customer\u2019s transport layout  \n- **Output parameter mapping** for Transport Assignment based on customer requirements  \n- **Price calculation logic** how input parameters are used to generate the necessary output parameters  \n- **Forms design (Rate Explorer)** to request rates (search rates) using manual input parameters for price calculation within UI  \n\nThe whole script is designed as a config monolith (see)  \n\n### Level of custom specific code and possibility to shift to self-service  \nCurrently, all 5 parts are maintained by Customer Care / Professional services as they are strictly bound to each other. They differ a lot in terms of how they can be shifted from programming (by PS and CC) to customer self-service.  \n- **Rate tables**  \nThey show the highest level of standardization. Most requirements of their customization are driven by customers and do not require a high level of development knowledge. They are mainly derived from customer existing input data available in Excel or internal systems like SAP or Oracle.  \n\u2192 Rate tables show a high qualification for customer\u2019s self-service  \n\n- **Input parameters from Transport**  \nInput parameters are highly dependent on customized fields in Transports. As soon as these parameters are shifted to a standardized definition, the current customer-specific mapping becomes obsolete as their main purpose is to adapt RM2 to customer-specific behavior in transport  \n\u2192 Customer self-service is possible the less parameters in transport deviate from standard behavior  \n\n---\n### Current processing  \nIn current RM2 Groovy code, there is a need to map each of the incoming parameters that are used in the context of the customer  \nFor example:  \n```groovy\ninputMapping \"XML\", {\n  field \"origin_country\" is 'tour/shipment[1]/station[@type=\\'loading\\']/country_id'\n  field \"origin_zip\" is 'tour/shipment[1]/station[@type=\\'loading\\']/zip'\n  field \"destination_country\" is 'tour/shipment[1]/station[@type=\\'unloading\\']/country_id'\n  field \"destination_zip\" is  'tour/shipment[1]/station[@type=\\'unloading\\']/zip'\n  field \"weight\" is  'tour/weight'\n  field \"count_dg_shipments\" is \"count(tour/shipment/dlclass)\"\n  field \"vehicle_type\" is \"tour/shipment[1]/vehicle_name\"\n  field \"count_deliveries\" is \"count(tour/shipment)\"\n  field \"count_distinct_unloads\" is \"count(tour/shipment/station[@type='unloading']/city[not(text()=../../following-sibling::shipment/station[@type='unloading']/city/text())]/text())\"\n  field \"carrier\" is 'tour/assigned_creditor_number'\n  field \"validityDate\" is 'tour/start_date'\n}\n```\n\n### Standardization approach  \nWith standardization, we are going to introduce an internal RM2 specific model of a transport and automatically map all fields with known usage:  \nData in transport that currently qualifies for such automatic mapping are  \n- departure location (first loading) and destination location (last unloading) with the following parameters  \n  - country (already ISO2)  \n  - postal code  \n  - state  \n  - address number  \n  - city  \n\n- assigned carrier  \n- weight, volume, length, storage places, distance including their measure units  \n- vehicle type  \n- tour start / tour end dates  \n\n- **Standard / product-related parameters**  \n  - custom parameters that are based on a standardized behavior in TA \u2192 needs to be evaluated  \n\n### Customer specific data handling  \nWe are aware that there are still a lot of cases when some transport data does not comply to any standardization data. For those cases, we will still support a customer-specific mapping  \n- that mapping will happen in UI  \n- The mapping should be as standardized as possible (e.g., only map predefined transport fields)  \n\n### Other transport sources  \nThe same internal model can also be used to map other external transport sources like TOPS.  \n\n### Migration approach from Groovy to \u201cNew world\u201d  \nThat new model with standard fields will be available in current groovy configuration to utilize the data in the current world. Furthermore, all fields can then be automatically applied in table-related price calculations.  \nThat will allow removing inputMapping from current groovy configuration   \n\n### Summary  \nThe customer experience with RM2 is intended to shift from a manual, scripting-dependent process towards a more standardized, self-service model where customers can manage rate tables and configurations with ease. This involves defining clear workflows, establishing standardized data formats, and ensuring that both customer-specific and general use cases are appropriately supported through ongoing refinement of the system.  \n\n### References  \n- [Rate Management API](https://api.transporeon.com/hub/)  \n- [Visibility API](https://api.transporeon.com/hub/?urls.primaryName=Visibility%20API)  \n- [Countries and territories](https://unece.org/trade/cefact/unlocode-code-list-country-and-territory)  \n- [Subdivision Codes](https://service.unece.org/trade/locode/2022-2%20SubdivisionCodes.htm)  \n- [UNLOCODE-Download](https://unece.org/trade/cefact/UNLOCODE-Download)  \n- [Six Group](https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/financial-information/data-standards.html)  \n\nThe content is extensive and has been formatted for clarity.
