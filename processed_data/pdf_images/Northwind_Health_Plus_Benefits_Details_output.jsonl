The portion of the cost that you are required to pay is known as the **Allowed Amount**. The Allowed Amount is the amount that the plan will pay towards the cost of care. The Allowed Amount may vary depending on the type of care received.\n\nFor example, if you receive services from an in-network provider, the Allowed Amount may be lower than if you receive services from an out-of-network provider. The Allowed Amount also may vary depending on the type of service, such as routine care, preventive services such as physicals, vaccinations, and screenings have lower Allowed Amounts than other types of care.\n\nYou should always check with the provider prior to receiving services to understand what your financial responsibility will be and how the Allowed Amount will apply.\n\n**Note:** If you request care outside of your network, please be aware that you may have higher financial responsibility than if you received care from in-network providers.\n\nIn some cases, Northwind Health Plus may require prior authorization for certain services. If pre-authorization is not obtained, you may be responsible for the entire cost of the service, regardless of your eligibility for benefits under Northwind Health Plus.\n\nIn addition, some services may be subject to pre-authorization or pre-certification. This means that you or your provider must obtain approval from Northwind Health Plus before the service is provided. Failure to obtain pre-authorization may result in a denial of benefits.\n\nIt is important to familiarize yourself with your plan, understand your responsibilities, and seek care from in-network providers whenever possible to minimize your financial obligations.\n```"}

Subrogation is the process by which Northland Health Plus pays for your medical services first and then seeks reimbursement from any secondary medical coverage. In other words, if you were to have coverage through Northland Health Plus and another provider, Northland Health Plus will pay the costs of medical services first.\n\nReimbursement works in the opposite way. It is the process by which Northland Health Plus pays for medical services and then requests that another medical provider reimburse them for covered medical services that were provided to you. \n\nBecause both processes are important elements, it is important to note that Northland Health Plus can process your claims for any medical services that are covered under your health insurance service. This includes reimbursements for co-pays and deductibles that you may have incurred, if applicable. Claims will be processed and you will receive notification from Northland Health Plus once they are submitted.\n\nWhen it comes to subscribing, it is important to remember that Northland Health Plus will only cover costs associated with the services that you receive that are deemed necessary based on guidelines set forth by the provider. \n\nIt is also important to remember that Northland Health Plus\u2019s subscription may not cover every medical service you receive, so it is important to keep detailed records of all medical services that you receive. This includes records of payments made by you, other insurance companies, and Northland Health Plus. Additionally, it is important to keep a record of any documentation you submit to Northland Health Plus to support your claims.\n```\n\n### Notes on Graphs and Images:\n- No graphs or images were mentioned in the image provided, so there are no descriptions required. \n\nThis markdown captures the structure and formatting as described.

The amount you must pay out of your own pocket before the plan begins to pay for covered services is called the **calendar year deductible**. This is an important part of your health plan.\n\n## In-Network Services\n\n- For in-network services, the calendar year deductible is **$1,500** for individuals and **$3,000** for families. This means that you must pay out of pocket for covered services until you reach a total of **$1,500** in individual claims and **$3,000** in family claims.\n\n## Out-of-Network Services\n\n- The plan does not have a calendar year deductible for **out-of-network** services. However, these services may be subject to higher coinsurance and copayment amounts. \n\n### Exceptions\n\n- Certain entries are exempt from the calendar year deductible, such as:\n  - Preventive services\n  - Emergency services\n\n### Tips:\n\n- **Check** with your provider to find out if a service is subject to the calendar year deductible before receiving care.\n- **Make sure** you understand the cost sharing that applies to out-of-network services.\n\n### Important Note:\n\n- The calendar year deductible is reset each year on the plan's renewal date.\n\n---\n\n# Coinsurance\n\n**IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Coinsurance**\n\nCoinsurance is a cost-sharing requirement in your health plan. This means that after you have met your deductible, you will be responsible for certain percentages of the costs for covered services. The coinsurance rate is usually a percentage of the allowed amount for a service, and it is your responsibility to pay this amount.\n\n- For example, if the allowed amount for a service is **$100** and your coinsurance is **20%**, you are responsible for paying **$20** (20% of $100). The insurance company will pay the remaining amount of **$80**.\n```\n"}

However, if you choose to receive care from an out-of-network provider, your out-of-pocket costs may be higher. Therefore, it is important to consider the cost of out-of-network care when needing to seek emergency care.\n\n## Tips to Keep in Mind:\n\n1. **Check with North Health Plus to make sure the provider is in-network.**\n   \n2. **Use the searchable directory on their website to find a provider who is in-network.**\n\n3. **Consider the care you might receive at the North Health Plus network.**\n\n4. **Understand the costs associated with in-network providers when making your decision.**\n\n5. **Ask for provider recommendations from your family and friends.**\n\n6. **Make sure the provider is familiar with your health insurance plan and its coverage.**\n\n7. **Use caution when choosing a provider.**\n\n8. **Surprise billing: Your provider\u2019s billing can also confuse your choice.**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nChoosing an in-network provider is an important part of getting the most value out of your health plan. In-network providers usually have agreements with your health insurance provider that ensure lower costs. While it's easier to choose an in-network provider, it's important to consider all of your options.\n\n## HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS: Continuity of Care\n\nContinuity of care is important when selecting a provider. Quality of care is often impacted by the same provider being responsible for your medical history, which can lead to more effective treatments. Also, if you stay with the same provider for an extended period, your provider is more likely to know about any changes in your health and can offer more personalized care.\n```"}
