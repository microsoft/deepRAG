On the other hand, if you use out-of-network providers, you'll be responsible for a larger portion of the cost. In some cases, you may be responsible for the entire cost.\n\nIt is important to note that in-network providers are not necessarily the same across all plans. Even if a provider is in-network for one plan, they may not be in-network for another. Therefore, it's important to check if your provider is in-network before you select them.\n\n## When selecting a provider, here are a few tips you should keep in mind:\n\n- **Research your provider's credentials.** Are they properly licensed and accredited?\n  \n- **Consider their experience.** What kind of patients have they treated?\n  \n- **Ask about their services.** Do they offer evidence-based treatments? Are they up-to-date on the latest guidelines?\n\n- **Ask about their approach.** Do they offer preventive services or methods?\n  \n- **Inquire about payment options.** What types of payment plans do they offer? How do they compare to other providers in your network?\n\n- **Consult your insurance plan.** What are your options for care and coverage?  \n\nBy taking the time to research your provider, you can ensure you're getting the best care possible from a trusted provider. Remember, Health Plus does not recommend a specific provider over another, but can help you choose the plan's network provider that best meets your needs.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help selecting a provider, you can always contact Northfield Behavioral Health's service team. They can provide you with helpful information and advice about the right provider for your needs.\n\nBy following these steps and doing your research, you can make sure you're getting the best care possible with Northfield Health Plus.

{"markdown_content": "```markdown\n# IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION\n\n**Copayments (Copays)**\n\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Copayments (Copays)\n\nWhen using Northwind Health Plan, you may be responsible for a copayment for (copay) for certain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you pay to a service provider. The amount of the copayment varies based on the type of service received, whether the service is rendered by an in-network versus an out-of-network provider.\n\n## In-Network Copays:\n\nFor in-network services, your copayment is often lower than out-of-network services. The copayment for primary care visits is typically around **$20**, while specialist visits have a copayment of **$40**. For in-network emergency services, there is typically a copayment of **$100**.\n\n## Out-of-Network Copays:\n\nFor out-of-network services, your copayment is typically higher. The copayment for primary care visits is approximately **$50**, while specialist visits are usually around **$90**. Emergency services received outside of your in-network providers may incur a higher copayment, and you may be responsible for the remaining balance.\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n1. **It is important to remember that copayments are subject to the amount listed above.** For example, for mental health services, the copayment may differ based on the provider.\n   \n2. **It is also important to note that copayments are not waived for out-of-network providers.** You may be responsible for the remaining balance after Northwind Health Plan has paid its portion.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that the provider you are seeing is in-network. This can be easily checked by reviewing your directory on the Northwind Health Plan website. It is also important to remember that if you receive a service from an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for a higher copayment.\n```"}

You visit your primary care provider.\n   2. Your doctor recommends that you see a specialist.\n   3. You go to that specialist and incur an additional copay.\n\nWhen visiting your doctor, it is important to understand which type of provider you are visiting. Knowing your doctor's specialty and training\u2014in addition to their professional credentials and accreditation\u2014is important. Your insurance card will show you your insurance card.\n\nIt is important to remember that the split copay only applies in certain instances.

The amount you must pay out of your own pocket before the plan begins to pay for covered services is known as the calendar year deductible. The calendar year deductible is the same for:\n\n1. **In-Network Services**: The calendar year deductible is $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families.

You should still maintain minimum essential coverage under a private plan, or a government-supported program. The Northwind Health Plus plan is included in those plans.\n\n## Tips for Making the Most of Your Health Plan\n\n- **Know what your plan covers:** Familiarize yourself with your plan documents and know what is covered and what is not.\n\n- **Use in-network providers:** Whenever possible, use providers in your health care network, as these will help you to save money.\n\n- **Consider your Northwind Health\u2019s 24/7 Nurse Line:** This can help you save money and get timely advice.\n\n- **Utilize Northwind Health\u2019s online services:** These tools allow you to easily order and manage your prescriptions.\n\n- **Keep track of your health care services:** Make sure to check that the provider is in-network and that the services are covered by your plan.\n\n- **Understand your costs:** This will help you to better understand your plan and stay on top of your health care expenses.\n```\n"}

Subrogation is the process by which Northwind Health Plus seeks reimbursement for expenses that are incurred as a result of a secondary medical coverage. In other words, if you have another plan through Northwind Health Plus and you receive services, Northwind Health Plus may be able to reduce the costs of medical expenses as a result of this secondary coverage.\n\nReimbursement works in the opposite way. It is the process by which Northwind Health Plus ensures that you are reimbursed for medical services that you receive under your primary insurance. \n\nWhen you receive medical services, it is important to notify Northwind Health Plus so that they can ensure that your secondary insurance is billed for those services. This includes notifying Northwind Health Plus of your other insurance companies, and ensuring that they are paid quickly. \n\n## Key Points\n\n- When notifying Northwind Health Plus:\n  - It is important to inform them that Northwind Health Plus is your primary insurance.\n  - You should include details of any secondary insurance plans.\n\nTo ensure that you are able to take full advantage of Northwind Health Plus\u2019s subrogation and reimbursement services, it is important to keep detailed records of all medical services that you receive.

This is important because it can help you recover any expenses that you have incurred, including co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles.\n\nHowever, if you choose to file a claim with your insurance company, and then the provider who charged you, in some cases, if they have already paid the provider, they may be unwilling to reimburse you.\n\nThere are some restrictions and exceptions to this provision that you should be aware of.

If you do not notify the provider, they may refuse to accept assignment of your claim after the services were rendered and within six months of the date of service.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that just because your insurance covers the medical service does not guarantee that the insurance company will be able to recover the money you paid. They may also have the ability to recover the costs from the provider, which could potentially be an issue.\n\nFinally, if you have already paid a provider for a service that is covered under the plan, it is important for you to keep a record of your payments and the services received, as this can help substantiate your claim.\n\nTo sum up, the Right of Recovery provision under Northwind's Health Plan is an important feature that can assist with recouping out-of-pocket medical expenses.

At Northwind Health Plus, infusion therapy is covered as long as the treatment is medically necessary and prescribed by a doctor.\n\n**Exceptions:**\n\nThere are a few exceptions to coverage of infusion therapy under Northwind Health Plus.

This means that if you have been seeing the same provider for a period of time, you may be able to continue seeing them without having to switch to a different provider in the network.\n\nHowever, it's important to understand that this coverage is subject to the continuity of care rules. For example, you may be required to switch to an in-network provider. Additionally, if you are switching from an out-of-network provider, you may be facing higher costs.\n\n## Tips for Continuity of Care\n\nWhen it comes to your care provider, it's important to keep continuity of care in mind. Here are a few tips that you can follow:\n\n- Ask your provider if they are in-network.\n- Check to see if your current provider is accepting new patients.\n- If you are new to the area, make sure you are familiar with your network providers.\n\n## How to Find Providers\n\n- If you are an in-network provider, ask for a referral.\n- If you are switching from an out-of-network provider, Northwind Health Plus may cover certain services.\n\n### Continuity of Care\n\nContinuity of care is typically intended for those who are already receiving treatment. Northwind Health Plus requires providers to verify that you have been receiving treatment before you are permitted to stay with the same provider. If you need to switch providers, please ensure that you have the necessary coverage and understand your obligations.\n\n## How Provider Choice Affects Your Costs\n\nWhen it comes to health care, the provider you choose can have a major impact on your costs. If you choose a provider that is not in-network, you will be responsible for the entire cost of the care. This means that, if you choose to visit a provider who is not in-network, you will have to pay the entire cost of the service out-of-pocket.\n```\n\nIf there are any tables or graphs in the image that you want me to describe or convert, please let me know!"}
