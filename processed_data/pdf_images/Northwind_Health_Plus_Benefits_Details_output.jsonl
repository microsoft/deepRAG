You will need to provide your other employer plan\u2019s information in order to coordinate benefits.\n\n### Exceptions\nThere are a few situations when you may not have to coordinate benefits with your other health care plans. For example, you cannot coordinate benefits with a health plan that is not considered other health coverage. If you are enrolled in a health plan that is a high-deductible plan, you cannot coordinate benefits.\n\n### Tips\nIf you have other health coverage, here are a few tips to help you coordinate benefits with Northwind Health Plus:\n\n- **Know which health care providers you may use when you need Northwind Health Plus.**\n  \n  Make sure you check that your health care providers are in the Northwind Health Plus network to ensure that you don\u2019t have to pay out-of-pocket costs.\n\n- **Ask your other employer\u2019s Benefits (BOB) coordinator for help with how to manage your benefits.**\n\n  Ask for guidance on coordinating benefits with Northwind Health Plus and other benefits are paid for, so that you can make the most of your health care coverage.\n\n### Other Coverage\n**WHAT IS OTHER COVERAGE?**\n\nThe term \u201cOther Coverage\u201d is defined as any other insurance, health plan, or program that provides medical services and supports for medical care that is not provided under your Northwind Health Plus plan. Other coverage may include employer plans or government-sponsored plans.\n\nWhen you have other coverage, Northwind Health Plus follows something called \u201cCoordination of Benefits\u201d (COB). This means that Northwind Health Plus coordinates its benefits with the other coverage to ensure that you receive the maximum amount of benefits available to you.

Continuity of care is the process of providing care that is coordinated by the same provider over a period of time. This helps the provider gain a better understanding of your medical history, which can lead to more effective treatments. Also, if you stay with the same provider for an extended period, your provider is likely to know more about any changes in your health and can offer more personalized care.\n```"}

Subrogation is the process by which Northland Health Plus assumes the right to recover costs associated with providing health care for services rendered to an individual who has secondary medical coverage. In other words, if you have coverage through Northland Health Plus and another insurance provider, Northland Health Plus may be able to recover the costs of medical services from that other insurance provider.\n\nReimbursement works in the opposite way. It is the process by which Northland Health Plus will reimburse you for medical services that you paid for out of pocket, and that should be covered by your primary insurance.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\nWhen considering reimbursement, it is important to note that Northland Health Plus can only reimburse for services that are covered under your plan. You will need to keep detailed records of all medical services you receive, including receipts and payment records, to ensure that you can provide the necessary documentation.\n\nWhen it comes to subrogation, it is important to remember that Northland Health Plus will only recover costs for health services that were provided as a result of a third-party liability, such as an accident. If you have been injured in an accident and are receiving treatment, Northland Health Plus may work with an attorney to recover costs associated with your medical care.\n\n## Record Keeping\n\nIt is essential to remember that Northland Health Plus plays a vital role in ensuring that claims are processed accurately and in a timely manner. Therefore, it is important to keep detailed records of all medical services that you receive. This includes records of payments made by you, your other insurance companies, and Northland Health Plus. Additionally, it is important to keep a record of any documentation you submit to Northland Health Plus to support your reimbursement claims.\n```"}

A copayment is a fixed amount that you pay to a service provider. The amount of the copayment varies based on the type of service received, whether the service is rendered by an in-network or out-of-network provider.\n\n### In-Network Copays:\n\nFor in-network services, your copayment amount is typically lower than that of out-of-network services. The copayment for primary care visits is approximately **$20**, while specialist visits have a copayment of approximately **$50**. For in-network emergency services, the copayment is typically **$100**.\n\n### Out-of-Network Copays:\n\nFor out-of-network services, your copayment amount is usually higher. The copayment for primary care visits is approximately **$50**, while specialist visits can cost around **$100**. For out-of-network emergency services, you are typically accountable for a larger portion of out-of-network coinsurance, and you may be responsible for the remaining balance.\n\n---\n\nIt is important to remember that copayments are subject to the amount listed above. For example, for mental health services or preventative visits, copayment amounts may vary. It is essential to check with Northwind Health Plans for the most updated copay information.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **In-network services** have lower copayments.\n- **Out-of-network services** typically result in higher copayments.\n- Always verify your copayment amounts with Northwind Health Plans.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that the copayment is based on the network you are in\u2014this can be easily checked by browsing your directory on the Northwind Health Plans website. It is also important to know that if you receive a service from an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for a higher copayment.\n```"}

This coverage includes a wide range of services such as nursing care, physical therapy, and other rehabilitation services. The services are generally provided on an inpatient basis in a skilled nursing facility setting.\n\nThis plan also provides coverage if you are placed in a Medicare-certified skilled nursing facility, as well as services provided in a non-Medicare-certified skilled nursing facility, but only if a physician has determined that you need care in a non-Medicare-certified facility to be used temporarily.\n\nThese services, while generally provided under the supervision of a physician, can include nursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy as medically necessary and must be ordered by the patient\u2019s attending physician.
