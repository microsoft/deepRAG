Invite carriers to share their real-time visibility data, monitor their network performance, and ensure the quality provision of real-time visibility services.\n\nIt contains two main features:\n\n1. **Carrier Network** displays the data sharing consent of the carriers and their onboarding status in Visibility Hub.\n2. **Visibility Performance** displays in detail how each carrier in your network is performing.\n\n#### Carrier network tab\n\n![Carrier Network Tab](The image displays a user interface for a \"Visibility Control Center,\" likely part of a logistics or transport management system. \n\nKey elements in the image include:\n\n- **Header**: \"Visibility Control Center\" along with options for filters and views, such as \"Carrier Network\" and \"Visibility Performance.\"\n- **Filter section**: Displays a filter for \"68 companies\" for the current week along with a start time setting.\n- **Table**: A list of companies with columns for:\n  - **Company names**: E.g., ZUM Spedition, Reinhardt Internationale Spedition.\n  - **Actions**: Number of actions taken (e.g., the first entry shows 62 actions).\n  - **Transports**: Count of transports associated with each company.\n  - **Onboarding Status**: Indicates if each company is \"Connected.\"\n  - **Consent Status**: Indicates if consent has been \"Accepted.\"\n\nOverall, it appears to be a dashboard for tracking transport and logistics performance of various companies.)\n \nThe Carrier network tab shows the data sharing consent and onboarding statuses of all the carriers within the carrier network.\n\nFind out more about the consent management [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014082-consent-management-for-shippers).\n\n#### Onboarding status\n\nThis shows the Carrier\u2019s onboarding status in the Visibility Hub environment. Carriers with status **connected** have been/are providing real-time visibility to customers. The statuses can be \u2013 connected, onboarding stuck, in progress, ready for tracking, registered, invited. A detailed description of different statuses can be found [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4376177-transport-network-onboarding-tab).\n\nClicking on the company name in the list opens a popup with more detailed info about the carrier\u2019s onboarding progress and data sharing consent.\n\n![Onboarding Status](The image displays a user interface for a \"Visibility Control Center,\" which appears to be related to monitoring and managing logistics or carrier network performance. It contains a table listing various logistics companies along with details such as \"Actions,\" \"Transports,\" and connectivity status.\n\nKey details include:\n\n- A filter option allowing users to view data for a specific time frame.\n- A list of companies, each with a count of transports they handled this week.\n- Specific information about \"ZUM Spedition,\" including a consent status for data sharing marked as \"Accepted,\" and that it is \"Connected\" with a last status change date of May 5, 2020.\n- An onboarding status history outlining various stages from invitation to connection.\n\nThe interface elements involve dropdown filters and status notifications to facilitate usability and provide insights into the performance of the listed logistics companies.)\n\n**Onboarding status report**\n\nThis report displays the onboarding statuses and the number of carriers under each status for the period chosen.\n\n![Onboarding Status Report](The image displays a user interface from a \"Visibility Control Center.\" It includes several sections and controls:\n\n1. **Header**: At the top, there is a title \"Visibility Control Center\" along with navigation tabs labeled \"Carrier Network\" and \"Visibility Performance.\"\n\n2. **Filters Section**: Below the header, there's a filter option showing \"68 companies\" for the current week, along with a \"Start time\" setting.\n\n3. **Onboarding Status**: The main content area illustrates a progress bar divided into sections indicating different onboarding statuses: \n   - In progress (represented in yellow)\n   - Ready for tracking (represented in light gray)\n   - Onboarding stuck (represented in red, indicating a problem)\n   - Connected (represented in green)\n\nThe layout suggests this tool is used for monitoring the onboarding status of various companies, particularly focusing on their progress and any issues that may arise.)\n\n#### Inviting new carriers to share data\n\nYou can also invite new carriers through the Visibility Hub application to share real-time visibility with you. Simply click the \u201cInvite carriers\u201d button at the top right of the page. A detailed description of how to expand the carrier network can be found [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4885911-providing-real-time-visibility-via-your-subcarriers).\n\n#### Visibility Performance\n\n![Visibility Performance](The image displays a dashboard for a \"Visibility Control Center,\" specifically focusing on \"Visibility Performance\" for a set of 38 companies over the current week. \n\nKey elements include:\n\n1. **Header Information**: Sections for \"Saved filters,\" \"Carrier Network,\" and \"Visibility Performance.\" \n\n2. **Filter Options**: Users can filter by visibility status (e.g., \"Ready for tracking,\" \"Connected\") and set a timeframe (\"Start time: This week\").\n\n3. **Company List**: A table listing various companies with their corresponding visibility percentages, progress notes, allocation percentages, and additional metrics.\n\n4. **Metrics Displayed**:\n   - **Visibility**: Percentages indicating how visible each company is (e.g., 97% for ZUM Spedition).\n   - **Progress Indicators**: Numerical values showing progress since the last update.\n   - **Allocation Metrics**: Percentages and notes related to allocation efforts.\n   - **Unallocated, Upcoming, and Tracking Now**: Numerical values indicating unallocated transports, upcoming actions, and current tracking statuses per company.\n\nThe overall design appears structured, providing at-a-glance metrics for monitoring the performance of these companies in managing visibility and logistics.)\n\n**Why is this feature valuable?**\n\nThe Visibility Performance tab shows the list of carriers in the carrier network and how well they are doing in terms of real-time visibility. The two most important figures here are the visibility index and allocation rating.\n\n**The visibility index** displays the quality of real-time visibility tracking by each carrier on a scale of 0-100.\n\n**The allocation rating** shows how many transports had a license plate assigned compared to the overall number of transports of the carrier.\n\n#### Filtering options in the Visibility Control Centre\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to create and save filters on both the Carrier Network and Visibility Performance tabs. The filters can be based on location, time, status, or customer and they help to easily display preferred data. Filters can be set by clicking on the \u201cFilter\u201d button on the top left of the page. A detailed description of filtering options can be found [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6028156-filtering-in-the-visibility-control-center).\n\n### References\n- [Get a full overview of your carriers\u2019 network performance and data sharing permissions](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6023034-visibility-control-center-for-shippers-lsps)\n- [Consent Management for Shippers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014082-consent-management-for-shippers)\n- [Transport Network Onboarding Tab](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4376177-transport-network-onboarding-tab)\n- [Providing Real-time Visibility via Your Subcarriers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4885911-providing-real-time-visibility-via-your-subcarriers)\n- [Filtering in the Visibility Control Center](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6028156-filtering-in-the-visibility-control-center)"}

{"url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014082-consent-management-for-shippers", "title": "Consent Management for Shippers", "content": "### Title\nConsent Management for Shippers\n\nHave a look at our Visibility Control Center with consent management. The Visibility Control Center is a crucial step, because it will help us to create and maintain trust between you, your carriers and Visibility Hub. High quality data is essential for you to monitor your supply chain in real time. With carriers actively deciding to share data, the quality of Real-time visibility will increase, giving you an even better overview over your supply chain.\n\n**What does data sharing mean?** \n\nSharing Real-time visibility data means that an allocated vehicle will provide real-time data for a given transport.\n\nWhen an allocated license plate is connected to Visibility Hub, our system will check if consent was given to share data with you. Once this is verified, GPS data will be shared for the specific transport.\n\n**Your visibility control center** \n\nUnder the tab \u201cCarrier Network\u201d you see all the Transport companies working with you. Here you can also invite carriers to join your network.  \n![Carrier Network](The image displays a user interface for a \"Visibility Control Center.\" It features a navigation bar on the left with options for saved filters, carrier network, and visibility performance. At the top, there's a section showing a filter for \"68 companies - This week\" with a start time specified. Below this, there's a table listing various companies such as \"Hennel Express,\" \"Schmidt Express,\" and \"M\u00fcller Logistic,\" along with their transport numbers and onboarding statuses. The transport numbers are shown next to each company, with all companies currently marked as \"Connected.\" The overall design appears to be clean and organized, focusing on logistics and transport data.)\n\nThe consent status shows which carriers have accepted or declined to share data with you during a transport.\n\n**Accepted**  \nThe carrier has agreed to share real-time visibility data from his network with you during a specific transport.\n\n**Declined**  \nThe carrier has actively declined sharing real-time visibility data with you.\n\nIf a carrier has declined the data sharing, you will see this in your transport network. Also if a transport is executed by a carrier who declined data sharing, you will be informed about a data sharing issue, when the transport was supposed to start.  \n![Data Sharing Issue](The image displays a tracking interface, likely from a logistics or delivery system. At the top, it indicates the time zone as Europe/Vienna with an offset of UTC +02:00. Below that, there's a section titled \"Overview\" and another titled \"Log.\" \n\nProminent in the center is a red box stating \"Tracking was cancelled\" along with the message \"No truck allocated.\" It also includes a timestamp, \"Today at 12:46,\" suggesting when the update was made. Additionally, on the left side, there\u2019s an icon with a red \"X,\" possibly indicating an error or cancellation status.)\n\n**Note:** If a carrier has accepted to share data but you still get a notification about a data sharing issue, there could be missing consent in the private transport network of the carrier. Ask your carrier to check the consent status of his carrier network. \n\nIf a carrier has declined the data sharing, reach out to the carrier directly and ask for the consent to be reactivated. This can be done by an admin user in just two clicks. ([Find out if you are an admin](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/8473503-user-roles-in-visibility-hub))\n\n**Best practice** \n- Check out your carrier network on a regular basis to make sure consent is accepted - and ask the same of your carriers. \n- Ask your carriers to make sure they have invited all their subcontractors they are using for your transports.\n\nShould you have any further questions please contact [support.transporeon.com](https://support.transporeon.com/)\n\n### References\n- [Carrier Network](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/collections/3312088-for-shippers)\n- [Find out if you are an admin](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/8473503-user-roles-in-visibility-hub)\n- [support.transporeon.com](https://support.transporeon.com/)"}

For this to happen  \n\n\u2705 Your vehicles need to be connected from your telematics provider platform to the Visibility Hub. ([click here to find out how](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-overview-connection-possibilities))  \n\u2705 The connected vehicles need to be allocated to the transport.\n\nThe allocation of a truck can be executed by all parties involved in the transport (= customer, partner, asset owner). However, the level of the visibility that is provided can be different depending on who allocated the transport and in which relationship they are to you.\n\n---\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 In Visibility Hub, there are 2 levels of visibility for an ongoing transport**  \n\n**Standard visibility**  \nETA calculated, transport status updates shared, truck position shared\n\nStandard Visibility is automatically provided if you have a direct relationship with your customer on the Visibility Hub and have agreed to share your GPS data. You can see all transports that provide visibility in the Visibility Hub.\n\n**Limited visibility**  \nETA calculated, transport status updates shared, NO truck position\n\nLimited visibility is automatically provided in situations where you have not yet accepted an invitation request to the Visibility Hub from your customer. You will be notified by email when such a license plate allocation is made and you can also track these shipments on the Visibility Hub by following the link we provide in the email or by searching for the license plate number.\n\nThe next section describes when standard and limited visibility is provided.\n\n---\n\n**\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Levels of visibility are different depending on the party that handles the allocation**\n\n\ud83d\ude9a\u2705 **The data owner** (=the carrier company that owns the truck)  \n- All allocations of own activated vehicles will lead to **standard real time visibility** (=ETA calculated, transport status updates shared, truck position shared)\n\n\ud83d\udd10\u2705 **The direct partner** (= another carrier company that has a confirmed relationship to the data owner in Visibility Hub and therefore is granted official access to the associated vehicles)  \n- All allocations of granted vehicles will lead to **standard real time visibility** (=ETA calculated, transport status updates shared, truck position shared).\n\n\ud83d\udd10\u26d4 **Any other partner** (= another carrier company that is active in Visibility Hub, but with whom the data owner does not have a confirmed relationship)  \n- They can allocate all Visibility Hub-active license plates to transports they are involved in but **real time visibility will be limited** (=ETA calculated, transport status updates shared, truck position **not** displayed).\n- Standard visibility will be provided instead of limited visibility once the data owner has actively accepted the invitation to the direct network of this partner.\n\n---\n\n**\ud83d\udd10 We protect your data**  \nRegardless of the level of visibility sharing, there are strict rules in place to prevent any type of transport and associated visibility information from being shared with outside parties:\n\n1. Transports are by design only accessible to parties involved in the transport.  \n2. Visibility can only be requested by parties with access to the transport.  \n3. In addition to the license plate allocation, the following criteria must be met in order for any level of visibility to be provided during the transport:  \n   - Truck Z (= active license plate) is allocated to transport A ([click here to find out how](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4359214-how-to-allocate-a-truck-license-plate))\n   - Truck Z actually enters the loading location of transport A.\n   - Truck Z drives to the unloading point.\n\n---\n\n### References\n- [click here to find out how](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-overview-connection-possibilities): Link for connecting vehicles to Visibility Hub.\n- [click here to find out how](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4359214-how-to-allocate-a-truck-license-plate): Link for instructions on allocating a truck license plate."}
