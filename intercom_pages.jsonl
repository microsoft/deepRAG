{"id": "6167059", "html": "<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">In order for Visibility Hub to provide real-time visibility, it\u2019s essential to know which vehicle is doing which transport. This is accomplished by bringing two data streams together: The transport information and the GPS feed from the vehicle. This process is called \"vehicle allocation\" and is done by assigning a vehicle via its license plate number to a transport described by its identification number. </p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1128911765/5c8b7a05d613046689d29735/img1.png?expires=1731338100&amp;signature=3aa2befcddcff5187034651ba6e17e0999a25c34fa6c532ddcc9eb5e4ce4d3c3&amp;req=dSElHsB%2FnIZZXPMW1HO4zeduGDVt%2FB%2F%2Fo7IScVX3oTzuNtBemJ9zeSi8%2BPcr%0AmWcx%0A\"></div><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_282a483e3b\">Where it gets challenging</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">While this seems to be a rather easy task, one can imagine that with dozens or even hundreds of shipments a day, a manual allocation for visibility purposes is quite an overhead. This allocation is anyway done as part of the carrier\u2019s dispatching process and should therefore be automated. This can happen by sending this dispatch information from one machine (the carrier\u00b4s in-house IT system) to another machine (Visibility Hub and Transporeon) in the background without a need for manual user interaction: This can be enabled with a so called \"API\", short for Application Programming Interface.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1128920207/606f9387b87201c3fcda84e8/img2.png?expires=1731338100&amp;signature=feec2f2d35709ea5fe9657062c6773b875263e53a57cb43f31433b1aa497b10b&amp;req=dSElHsB8nYNfXvMW1HO4zTQtXhe8nxlmyt32eeWt0uDrZn9H9XXPlNBPuF0p%0AdUx1%0A\"></div><p class=\"no-margin\">So far so good, but there\u2019s an important point to consider: Master data.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">To make the best out of such an API connection, it\u2019s critical that the vehicle and transport identification in both, the carrier\u2019s inhouse IT system as well as Visibility Hub\u2019s system, are consistent. But that might sometimes not be the case:</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><i>For vehicles</i>, Visibility Hub retrieves the license plate number from the carrier\u2019s GPS provider. The carrier maintains the format in the webportal of the GPS provider. This license plate notation can deviate significantly from the one that is known to the carrier\u2019s in-house IT system. This is especially true, if vehicles are not directly owned by the carrier, but e.g. by a subcontractor.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1128920570/4d726c697ea4b3f76e784f8d/img3.png?expires=1731338100&amp;signature=81e5accc2c38e041f42675f88993afd835a19b0de92058840e520165ff533d59&amp;req=dSElHsB8nYRYWfMW1HO4zYcl3uBJoAIPPFW8mtITkJTgZ30SzeSLZU5eVRmM%0AgQPW%0A\"></div><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><i>For transports</i>, Visibility Hub retrieves various identifiers, which are exposed in different fields. Examples are the shipper\u2019s transport number, delivery, order number and others. As different customers might use different identifiers that are present in those fields, it\u2019s important to know where to find the correct one for a given customer. Also, the format or notation might slightly differ, which makes it hard for a machine (and even for a human) to identify the correct one.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1128921155/6e13986b6c9499ac896be732/img4.png?expires=1731338100&amp;signature=efbb5807b467c4edd70f61d0b154f4c7ea5749ab86921108b3a890dd3b8e1f40&amp;req=dSElHsB8nIBaXPMW1HO4zf349IC5jpBfoWIIVf9I5lYngaSb45bQzUYqEICb%0AMpX%2F%0A\"></div><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_9700d5a838\">But how can we solve these problems?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Small recap of what we have learned so far: Master data for the license plate and transport identification can be differently maintained in systems. As it's not easy to fix it in every system (different stakeholders, responsibilities, data owner etc), we're looking for a different solution approach.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">To combat these challenges, Visibility Hub released an API update that significantly improves the matching of vehicle license plates and transport identifications by using a smart algorithm. This algorithm allows the notation to differ between one system and another, even takes partial matches into account and looks up a lot of available data to make the (perfect) match. Don\u2019t worry, if this sounds complex to you, just take a look at the example below and you\u2019ll learn that it\u2019s quite simple.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_7d64c7258a\">Example</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Imagine you\u2019re in a bakery and you\u2019d like to get that incredible tasting bread that your friend recommended. You just can\u2019t remember exactly what it was called and where to find it, but you remember that it was a \u201c<i>whole grain bread</i>\u201d. You ask for it, and the friendly baker instantly knows that you\u2019d like to get the \u201cChristoph <i>whole grain bread</i> with pumpkin seeds\u201d.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">That\u2019s exactly how the API works:</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You ask for the vehicle with license plate number \u201cABC-123\u201d (like you have it in your inhouse IT system) and the system will give you \u201cABC 123 Henry\u201d as a result, as that\u2019s how it\u2019s represented in Visibility Hub because of how the carrier maintained it in its GPS provider\u2019s portal. Same goes for transport identification: Say the identifier that you got from your customer on order retrieval is \u201cord-012345\u201d and that\u2019s how you have it stored in your in-house IT system. Now you don\u2019t know exactly in which field this identifier is present in the Visibility Hub system, and you also don\u2019t know if the notation is identical. But you ask for it, and as a result you\u2019ll get the correct transport, even if the identifier known to Visibility Hub is \u201cord012345-001-v2\u201d.</p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1128921710/34dab56b5ec4aac90aa5f687/img5.png?expires=1731338100&amp;signature=3082b7cb4f064f7607bba942d76468a8fdc2edc5e4f5aef5d7b86123200e9280&amp;req=dSElHsB8nIZeWfMW1HO4zRQ1ve4SbZzj0FRo4HYxSUf7X43WhZ%2F0tG07QJmw%0AP%2F3F%0A\"></div><h2 id=\"h_fc1eb714c9\">Benefit</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Now you have the correct license plate and the correct transports identifier and your system sends this allocation information to the Visibility Hub system.

If there are 2 or more transports supposed to be loaded in the same location at the same time, Visibility Hub needs to decide which of the transports to track first.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Note:</b> The following only applies if the transports differ from each other at least by timeslot or location. If they are exactly the same and also have the same vehicle allocated, they will be tracked in parallel.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Transports allocated to the same vehicle are ordered by the loading timeslot start (earliest first) and tracking is started by that order.

{"id": "5800433", "html": "<h1 id=\"h_46cc2ddeb0\">Types of emissions</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Proper emission accounting requires looking at a full lifecycle of fuel. Direct transport emissions are not only what is coming out from the exhaust pipe: drilling and manufacturing of the fuel, transporting to the gas station has its own footprint which has to be taken into account. Also production of trucks, building and maintenance of roads, etc are part of transport emissions. This chain can go quite far, but in practice and according to the GHG Protocol the following scopes for fuel emissions are calculated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Well-to-Tank</b> (WtT or W2T) - production and transportation of one liter of fuel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Tank-to-Wheel</b> (TtW or T2W) - all what happens \"after tank\", i.e. direct emission of CO\u2082 (and other gases) from the vehicle internal combustion engine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Well-to-Wheel</b> (WtW or W2W)- sum of the two above, <b>total life cycle</b> emission - this is the main figure you want to use for reporting and other uses.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/698075715/e8907c60101ef6e531b02a2f/d32b4145-591a-4510-be66-bfe0399de91e?expires=1731338100&amp;signature=e57605e27ee9192ecf2098548789e14d7dcd2cd662b5f6e6e7b4189415d3e229&amp;req=cikvFs57moBaFb4f3HP0gCLYlO4Pp1cGJMN%2BLjdiPvdGOMUl0LjaKquVMaXQ%0A%2Fkk%3D%0A\"></div><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_9689a85b22\">Key terms and definitions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>CO\u2082e intensity</b> or <b>specific emission</b>. Shows how much emissions are created to move <b>one tonne</b> of goods for <b>one kilometer</b>, i.e. how effective is the transport. This is a more suitable measure for comparisons than the raw CO\u2082e, because the total raw number depends also on the distance and the weight of goods. Unit: \u201cgrams per tonne-km\u201d, meaning how many grams to move one metric ton for one km was emitted. Typical truck transport value is about 80 g per t-km, and lower value is better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Carbon Data Index</b> shows how good data input was given to be used for calculations. If only shipper data is given, then this is low (below 20%), if also carrier primary data is available then it is higher, up to 100%. Higher is better. See details below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Scope 3 Coverage Rate</b>: the share of transports that have emission calculated. In general we try to calculate at least default-based emissions for 100% transports, but sometimes it is not possible due to missing or incorrect data. Typical data issues are inaccurate addresses, missing stop coordinates or completely wrong coordinates so route cannot be found.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Total CO\u2082e </b>- CO\u2082 equivalent, standard industry measure which factors in all emitted greenhouse gases (not only CO\u2082, but also methane etc) with their respective impact. Unit: metric tonne. Lower value is better, but if number of transports or distance increases then it goes up, so for comparison intensity is often better measure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Transport Performance</b> shows quantity of transports - in tonne-kilometers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>CO\u2082e reduction potential</b> shows maximum reduction with \u201c<b>optimal scenario</b>\u201d which means lowest possible emission for specific set of transports/lanes. Usually the lowest emission is rail transport, so effectively this is difference between road and rail transport.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\">Carbon measures are as default in metric units (grams, kilograms or tons), but users can choose 'imperial' units for US customary system (us tons and lbs).</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_27fb0fb16c\">Levels of calculation</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">We use following three main levels of calculation depending on the input data that is available for each transport:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Default</b> calculation uses minimal data - loading and unloading locations. If available for given transport, we use weight, mode of transport and general truck properties (e.g. whether it is reefer), otherwise we use standard defaults.</p>\n</li></ul><h4 id=\"h_7b2cc0986d\">\n<b><i>Update April 2023: </i></b><br><b><i>Following calculation methods are moved to new Carbon Intelligence product and are not available in reports here.</i></b>\n</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Modeled</b> calculation is more accurate and also takes into account the <b>real route distance</b> from RTV (telemetry we received from the allocated truck, trailer or IoT device), as well as more truck properties (if available).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Primary</b> data calculation collects <b>direct fuel consumption</b> or CO\u2082 emission data from the vehicles (and trailer if applicable) and uses fuel conversion factors to get accurate values for emissions. Fuel consumption data is available from more advanced telemetry systems. By default we use base factor 3.17 kg Well-to-wheel (2.54 Tank-to-Wheel) CO\u2082e per litre of fuel for road, and add 20% for industry average assumed empty miles.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\"><i>Modeled</i> and <i>Primary</i> calculation levels require that the carrier is providing proper RTV for specific transport. Visibility Hub shows clearly which level of calculation was used, and keeps different calculation levels as separate fields. Visibility Hub calculates RTV-based emissions at the end of the tour when we gather all relevant info about the transport. We keep track and can export all relevant parameters of the calculation, as well as specific tour metadata, like driven distance or measured liters of fuel. These can be made available for further validation and analysis.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_500ba83df7\">Calculation input and defaults</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Carbon footprint depends on several variables as input. We list the most important variables together with their defaults:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Estimated distance is calculated automatically from the shortest route between <b>loading and unloading locations</b> - <b>both locations are mandatory</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Transport mode</b>: road, rail, sea or ocean ship, air, inland waterways - all have very different footprints. Default: road (or ocean if road route is not possible). For \"multimodal\" transports we try to split them to single mode legs and give emission for each separately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Gross weight </b>of cargo. Default: 24 tons (for road).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Empty run factor</b>. Default: +20% for road, +50% for rail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Load factor</b>. How much of full truck capacity is used, by weight. Default: 60%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Type and size</b> of vehicle, depending on mode: trucks, trailers (e.g. reefer creates extra emissions), ships, trails. Default for road: depends on country; Class40 in most EU countries, Class60 in Nordic countries. Smaller trucks like vans have significantly higher emission intensity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Fuel type</b>. Default: diesel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Bio fuel</b> share. Depends on country, European average 5.43%.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Truck emission class (for road). Default: EuEuro6.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Used fuel amount. Default: assume average fuel consumption per km. Loaded automatically from RTV telemetry, if available.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If RTV is working for specific transport, then we recalculate footprint based on real travelled distance. So if the real route was e.g. 30% longer then also the emission result would become correspondingly bigger.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\">With more data we give always more accurate calculations and you see generally lower emission intensity values.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>It is important that shipper provides as many real transport values as possible</b> and avoids using defaults. The values must be given in <b>standard parameters</b> as standard values, not as part of textual descriptions or customer-specific fields of transports. Interface adjustment is usually needed to implement this properly.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">L<b>oading and unloading locations</b> must be present in one of following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Geographical coordinates: latitude and longitude - suggested for all</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Country and Postal Code (zip) - suggested for all (used for trade lane grouping)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">UN/LOCODE (for ocean transports)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">IATA Airport Code (for air transports)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">UIC Country/Code for Rail Station (for rail transports)</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\">Visibility Hub carbon emission calculation service is certified by SmartFreightCenter for GLEC framework compliance.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_ca1015c322\">Transport modes</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Depending how transports are provided to the Carbon Visibility service the transport modes are specified a bit differently. Two ways how transport data is given:</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">a) transports which are <b>uploaded</b> for carbon calculation specifically</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Single mode transports have simply specific optional field \"Mode\": road, rail, ocean, inland waterways or air.</p>\n</li></ul><ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">For intermodal transports with multiple modes there are following options:<br>(1) Most accurate result, suggested: <b>split transport by mode</b> and add each mode as separate transport delivery.<br> (2) If the split details are not known, but main mode is known (e.g. ocean transport but ports are not known) - <b>specifiy main mode</b>. Then we use nearest ports to loading and unloading as guessed ports.<br>(3) Sometimes mode is not known at all, e.g. overland intermodal container transports. Mode can be left, then we use \"<b>assume road if possible</b>\" heuristics, same as for \"Transporeon transports\". It should be used as the last resort and it will result highest conservative emission estimates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Provided Excel template includes samples for different modes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\">b) Transporeon (Transport execution service) <b>existing transports</b>, automatic carbon calculation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Transporeon transport management historically does not have standard field for transport mode. Transporeon customer connection integration needs to be updated to include <b>transport.mode</b> with one of the standard options as value. This usually requires <b>custom customer project</b> with Transporeon and customer IT involvement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Customer may have mode indication somehow in vehicle requirement or in a customer-specific parameter field, but emission calculations cannot use these fields directly. Therefore it is handled as \"undefined\" mode, where we use simple \"<b>assume road if possible</b>\" heuristical rule: (1) if there is road connection between loading and unloading, then we use road, (2) else (e.g. Europe or Asia to America) we <b>assume ocean</b>. This is generally good heuristics, but it also leads to a few known issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Technically there are long haul intercontinental road connections between Europe, Africa and Asia, therefore these routes do get calculated as road connections. For example there is road even from Japan to Germany, which is not often (or maybe ever) used, and it can lead to overestimate of carbon footprints on these routes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Ferry lanes are also part of road network, therefore some quite long overseas trips e.g. Germany to Iceland are calculated as road connected.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\">Following table illustrates approach to different modes and what would happen if these get unspecified or specified wrong</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/698075710/fb078bf0b5baba40be159868/b91d6e6c-a254-44a9-a796-f192f067caab?expires=1731338100&amp;signature=4e7b18702c20a09aac8f4b31ae0e17fee598c2a4a6c46a37f6f0ded6ff264aeb&amp;req=cikvFs57moBfFb4f3HP0gOONToU3WNSQ4Q1VVLMiZA6dttEWcoVAyfN1A2q8%0AF4Q%3D%0A\"></div><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_236c2e5404\">Carbon Data Index</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Transporeon uses own method<i> Carbon Data Index (CDI)</i> to measure and show input data completeness for every transport. CDI is in scale from 0% to 100%, and maximum index value 100% is when all the carbon calculation relevant data elements are present from all the needed parties. It is not simple to get to 100% - also fuel type and biofuel share, real (and not default) empty miles etc must be known. Carriers and shippers can see their aggregated scores with suggestions on how to improve it, often operations and technical developments by all sides (including Transporeon) have to be done.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Following figure shows different components of CDI and how to get it higher; the exact formula is in continuous development.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/698075709/eba463ce96f884b2a25b34f5/873033a3-b85e-43ae-856f-842e500df794?expires=1731338100&amp;signature=019e542b3281d8cd780be79685f8539d154047882f6aa6cb02d8ce60c0630372&amp;req=cikvFs57moFWFb4f3HP0gGrE3pYwGz8%2FvcBnPKjkO189OmjHE8fnd3w66mQX%0AsHo%3D%0A\"></div><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_f88e33f712\">References</h1>\n<ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><a href=\"https://www.smartfreightcentre.org/en/how-to-implement-items/what-is-glec-framework/58/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">GLEC framework</a></p>\n</li></ul>", "title": "Carbon Visibility Methodology", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5800433-carbon-visibility-methodology", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T06:45:29.130205"}

{"id": "5469197", "html": "<h2 id=\"h_d085c7e7cc\">What is the allocation rate?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">The allocation rate shows how many transports of a given carrier had a license plate assigned compared to the overall number of transports. This rate is always calculated for a certain timeframe and like all visibility metrics, it should be as close to 100% as possible.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_037d6034b7\">How is it calculated?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">For a given time range, Visibility Hub takes all the transports assigned to a carrier and checks how many of these transports do not have a license plate allocated. This value, which is shown in the Transport Network in the Unallocated column, is used in the following formula: <i>1 - (Unallocated transports / Total transports) = Allocation rate</i></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Example: Carrier A has 14 transports this week. For 2 of these, no license plates were  allocated. 1 minus the result of 2 divided by 14 is 0,86. Which is an allocation rate of 86%. If the carrier would now allocate license plates to the last two transports, the allocation rate will be 100%.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_983c076422\">Why is it important?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Transports without a license plate cannot be tracked by Visibility Hub. And without tracking, Visibility Hub receives no real-time visibility data which means we cannot predict when a transport will arrive for loading or unloading. Shippers rely on this information to prepare their facilities for loading and they share this information with customers to let them know when their goods will arrive. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_abddc31b5e\">How can it be improved?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">For carrier this is relatively simple and all that needs to be done is to always allocate license plates to transports. It does not take much time but it has a huge impact on the operations of shippers and customers. Please see this <a href=\"https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4359214-how-to-allocate-a-truck-license-plate\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">detailed guide on how to allocate transports as a carrier</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">For shippers, we recommend monitoring the progress carriers make over time with regards to the allocation rate. If they see that a carrier is now allocating less transports than before (lower allocation rate shown in Transport Network), please reach out to the carrier and discuss the reason for the lower rate.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>", "title": "Allocation rate", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5469197-allocation-rate", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T06:45:29.130213"}

Good to know</b></h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">In practice we know that there can be many reasons, why a truck is driving the route not in accordance to the transport plan. In Visibility Hub we take this into consideration as long as the truck visits the stops that are specified in the transport. Even if the truck services the stops in a different order, the transport will still be tracked. <br><br>However, if the truck is too far away from any of the stops, it is planned to visit, Visibility Hub will notify with the warning above to protect the privacy of your data. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Please note, the better Visibility Hub knows in which order the truck visits loading and unloading stops, the more accurate will be the calculated ETA in real time. If you see problems here,  please reach out to your shipper and discuss together, how the target of correct transports in the system can be achieved.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>", "title": "Warning: Unexpected truck behavior", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5162652-warning-unexpected-truck-behavior", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T06:45:29.130218"}
{"id": "5141793", "html": "<p class=\"no-margin\"><i>Are you looking for a general explanation of the Visibility index and how it can be improved? Have a look at <a href=\"https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4384183-visibility-index\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">this article in our help centre</a>.</i></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">The allocation rate and visibility index are the two most important indicators of how much visibility data a carrier is sending to Visibility Hub. The higher both values are, the better. The progress shown for each of these values tells you how much the carrier has improved or declined over a certain timeframe.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">To calculate the progress, Visibility Hub first calculates the allocation rate and visibility index of the <b>current period</b>. E.g. when you choose the start time \"This week\", Visibility Hub calculates the allocation rate and visibility index by looking at all transports that started this week. You can change the start time by choosing a different Start time filter value from the Filter dropdown in the Visibility view of the Transport Network.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Next, Visibility Hub calculates the allocation rate and visibility index of the <b>previous period</b>. The previous period is automatically chosen based on the current period. E.g. if the start time chosen is \"This week\" then Visibility Hub will look at all transports from last week to calculate the visibility index and allocation rate. If you choose \"Last week\" as start time, then the previous period will be the week before that. If you choose \"Last 30 days\", then Visibility Hub picks the previous month as period.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Once the values of both periods are calculated, we use a simple <b>subtraction</b> to calculate the <b>progress</b>: current_value - previous_value = progress. E.g. the start time is \"This week\" with a current allocation rate of 50% and a current visibility index of 35%. The previous week, the allocation rate was 56% and the visibility index was 30%.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Allocation rate progress: 50% - 56% = -6</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Visibility index progress: 35% - 30% = +5</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You can also choose \"Specific dates\" as current time period. Visibility Hub will use the exact same duration as previous period. E.g. you choose the 10 first days in May 2021 as current time period. So Visibility Hub will use the last 10 days of April 2021 as previous period for the progress calculation.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>", "title": "How allocation and visibility progress is calculated", "url": "https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5141793-how-allocation-and-visibility-progress-is-calculated", "timestamp": "2024-11-11T06:45:29.130220"}

General concept of tracking and vehicle management </b></h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>In order to provide real-time visibility (RTV) data on transports </b>you need to connect trackable assets to Transporeon Visibility Hub. The Visibility Hub is asset agnostic meaning an asset can be a trailer, a tractor, a mobile phone or any other device. The only requirement is that the asset has to be <b>trackable</b>, meaning sending position updates during transports.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">All assets in the Visibility Hub are called <b>vehicles</b>, and once <b>connected</b> they can be <b>allocated </b>to transports or <b>permanently shared</b> with your partners.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_07cf2f3a10\"><b>Connecting your vehicles</b></h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">In order to connect your <b>own vehicles</b> for transport execution, you need to integrate a <b>data source </b>to Visibility Hub. The easiest, fastest and most common way of connecting your vehicles is via a direct connection to your GPS (telematics system) provider but we also support several alternatives. Read more on <a href=\"https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4967926-overview-connection-possibilities\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">how to connect vehicles</a>. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">After adding the data source(s), the vehicles coming from these integrations will be connected to the Visibility Hub platform, displayed in your Vehicle Management view and are<b> ready for allocation and tracking.</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_2e4af2eca8\"><b>Recommendations</b></h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>1) Give Visibility Hub access to your fleet</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">In order to be sure that your current and future vehicles are available for tracking, we recommend <b>giving Visibility Hub permanent access to your entire fleet</b>. Our data engine only shares your data when the data sharing criteria is fulfilled (right vehicle at the right time and place for the specific customer). Data coming from vehicles not used for tracking will be discarded until the day you choose to share data. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>2) Let Visibility Hub manage the data of your fleet</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Save time and stay competitive by trusting Visibility Hub to manage the data of your fleet. You do not have to worry about adding/removing vehicles or switching on/off the data sharing, we will tell you if any actions are needed from your side.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>3) Grow and maintain a healthy fleet</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">When you follow our recommendations mentioned above all your vehicles should send frequent position updates to Visibility Hub. We call such vehicles \u201c<b>healthy vehicles</b>\u201d that are ready for tracking. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>4) Check the status of the vehicles frequently </b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Active vehicle \u2013</b> Visibility Hub has received a GPS position update within the last 96 hours.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Inactive vehicle \u2013 </b>Visibility Hub has <b>not received</b> a position update within the last 96 hours. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If the \u201cinactive\u201d vehicle is <b>from your own fleet</b>, check the status of the integration in the \u201cIntegrations\u201d tab on Visibility Hub and follow the instructions. In case of no instructions, please reach out to your GPS provider for support. Alternatively reach out to <a href=\"https://support.transporeon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">Transporeon support</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If the \u201cinactive\u201d vehicle<b> is not your own</b>, let your partner know and ask them to reach out to fix the issue with their GPS provider.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Please note! </b>The statuses are not related to any transports, meaning they only indicate the \u201chealth\u201d of the vehicle and the connection to Visibility Hub.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>5) Grow your vehicle network</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Make sure all the vehicles you use for existing and future customers are connected to Visibility Hub. If new vehicles are added to your fleet or you start working with a new subcontractor, make sure to connect them.

{"id": "4384183", "html": "<h1 id=\"short-description\"><b>Overview</b></h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">The Visibility Index sheds light on the quality of real time visibility tracking on transport level. The index is a percentage scoring from 0 to 100 based on objective criteria and updates in real time. A value of 50% indicates that only half of the transport was tracked in real-time. <br>\u200b</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">The index consists of several components that we call \u201cvisibility problems/issues\u201d (more details below). Its value is calculated at the time of completion or cancellation of a transport. Each transport can therefore have a unique visibility problem (or lack thereof). If there are several problems, the problem with the highest influence is displayed in the Visibility Hub Tour Details or Transport Network Report.<br>\u200b</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_14b1237442\"><b>How does each visibility problem influence the index?</b></h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Overall there are three variables influencing the value of the visibility index. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udca5= marks the underlying problem</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udc99 = marks the way to tackle the problem</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_acea2896f8\">1. The vehicle is unknown to Visibility Hub or does not send any GPS updates.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udca5 In Visibility Hub there is a strict rule: no license plate allocated = no truck will be made visible because the license plate allocation is the consent of the data owner to track the transport.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udca5 With no license plate allocated no visibility can be provided and the Visibility index will be 0.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udc99 Increase your visibility index to 100% by allocating all your transports.

The vehicle is allocated late or the GPS signal is provided after the start of the transport.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udca5 Real time tracking of the whole transport is not possible as GPS signals only reach us after the transport has already started.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udca5 One example: If the allocation was done 3 hours after the start of the tour and the duration of the tour is 10 hours, the visibility index will be 70% (your customer cannot track the transport during the first 3 hours - 30% of the tour).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udca5 The same logic applies to GPS signal that is not provided at tour start.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udc99 To increase your visibility index for allocated tours to 100% make sure your vehicles are allocated <b>before </b>the start of the transport.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"h_9a54264dbc\">3. The GPS signal provided is provided infrequently</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udca5 What is infrequent?: Visibility Hub requires 1 GPS point per 10 KM at least.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udca5 If GPS signals are received less frequent the visibility index will be reduced accordingly. It can also happen that GPS signal quality is bad only for parts of the tour. Of course this is also accounted for in the Visibility Index.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">\ud83d\udc99 To dig deeper into your individual problem please visit our tour detail view. Here you have the possibility to see on which parts of the tour the GPS signal was not sent properly. The best is usually to contact your GPS provider directly to ask them to solve the issue (log files can be downloaded from the tour details).</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-this-feature-valuable\">Why is this feature valuable?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">As a real-time visibility provider, Visibility Hub strives to provide as much REAL-time visibility as possible.
