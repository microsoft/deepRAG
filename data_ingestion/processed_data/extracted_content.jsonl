Invite carriers to share their real-time visibility data, monitor their network performance, and ensure the quality provision of real-time visibility services.\n\nIt contains two main features:\n\n1. **Carrier Network** displays the data sharing consent of the carriers and their onboarding status in Visibility Hub.\n2. **Visibility Performance** displays in detail how each carrier in your network is performing.\n\n## Carrier network tab\n\n![Carrier network tab overview](The image displays a user interface for a \"Visibility Control Center,\" likely used in logistics or supply chain management. It includes:\n\n- A header section with options to filter by \"Carrier Network\" and \"Visibility Performance.\"\n- A filter option showing \"68 companies\" for the current week.\n- A table listing various companies engaged in logistics, including columns for \"Actions,\" \"Transports,\" \"Onboarding Status,\" and \"Consent Status.\"\n- Each row features the company names and corresponding data, such as the number of transports and status indicators like \"Connected\" and \"Accepted.\"\n\nOverall, it appears to be a dashboard that monitors and manages logistics performance and connectivity with different carriers.)\n\nThe Carrier network tab shows the data sharing consent and onboarding statuses of all the carriers within the carrier network.\n\nFind out more about the consent management [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014082-consent-management-for-shippers).\n\n### Onboarding status\n\nThis shows the Carrier\u2019s onboarding status in the Visibility Hub environment. Carriers with status **connected** have been/are providing real-time visibility to customers. The statuses can be \u2013 connected, onboarding stuck, in progress, ready for tracking, registered, invited. A detailed description of different statuses can be found [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4376177-transport-network-onboarding-tab).\n\nClicking on the company name in the list opens a popup with more detailed info about the carrier\u2019s onboarding progress and data sharing consent.\n\n![Onboarding status popup](The image appears to display a dashboard for a \"Visibility Control Center,\" focusing on a \"Carrier Network\" with performance metrics for various transportation companies. \n\n### Key Features:\n- **Filter Section**: Options to filter by saved filters and time range (set to \"This week\" with 68 companies listed).\n- **Company List**: A table listing several companies, including ZUM Spedition, Dietrich Express, and others, showing associated transport counts and actions.\n- **Details Panel for ZUM Spedition**:\n  - Includes a Sixfold ID, date added, and data sharing consent status (accepted).\n  - Onboarding status is shown as \"Connected,\" with the last status change noted as May 5, 2020.\n  - Onboarding history indicates the progression through various stages (Not invited, In progress, Ready for tracking, Connected).\n\nOverall, it looks like a logistical management interface for tracking the performance and onboarding status of different transportation carriers.)\n\n**Onboarding status report**\n\nThis report displays the onboarding statuses and the number of carriers under each status for the period chosen.\n\n![Onboarding status report](The image displays a dashboard for a \"Visibility Control Center.\" It includes sections for saved filters, carrier network, and visibility performance, along with a filter option that shows data for 68 companies for the current week.\n\nBelow that, there\u2019s a visual representation of \"Onboarding status\" with a colored bar indicating the different stages of onboarding for the companies. The status is divided into four segments:\n\n- Yellow represents \"In progress.\"\n- White indicates \"Ready for tracking.\"\n- Red shows \"Onboarding stuck.\"\n- Green stands for \"Connected.\"\n\nThe majority of the bar is red, suggesting that a significant portion of the companies are currently stuck in the onboarding process.)\n\n## Inviting new carriers to share data\n\nYou can also invite new carriers through the Visibility Hub application to share real-time visibility with you. Simply click the \u201cInvite carriers\u201d button at the top right of the page. A detailed description of how to expand the carrier network can be found [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4885911-providing-real-time-visibility-via-your-subcarriers).\n\n## Visibility Performance\n\n![Visibility Performance](The image displays a dashboard titled \"Visibility Control Center\" focusing on visibility performance for a list of 38 companies for the current week. Key features include:\n\n1. **Filter Options**: The top section allows users to filter the data based on tracking readiness and connection status.\n   \n2. **Data Table**: Below the filter, there\u2019s a table with columns for:\n   - **Company**: Names of the companies listed.\n   - **Visibility**: Percentage indicating their current visibility status.\n   - **Progress**: Changes in visibility (up or down).\n   - **Allocation**: Percentage of allocation status.\n   - **Unallocated**: Number of unallocated transports.\n   - **Upcoming and Tracking Now**: Counts of future and currently tracked transports.\n\n3. **Status Indicators**: Some rows include notes with specific requests like checking telemetry quality or allocating trucks.\n\nOverall, the table provides a structured overview of logistics visibility and performance for several companies, facilitating efficient management and tracking.)\n\n### Why is this feature valuable?\n\nThe Visibility Performance tab shows the list of carriers in the carrier network and how well they are doing in terms of real-time visibility. The two most important figures here are the visibility index and allocation rating.\n\n**The visibility index** displays the quality of real time visibility tracking by each carrier on a scale of 0-100.\n\n**The allocation rating** shows how many transports had a license plate assigned compared to the overall number of transports of the carrier.\n\n## Filtering options in the Visibility Control Centre\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to create and save filters on both the Carrier Network and Visibility Performance tabs. The filters can be based on location, time, status or customer and they help to easily display preferred data. Filters can be set by clicking on the \u201cFilter\u201d button on top left of the page. A detailed description of filtering options can be found [here](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6028156-filtering-in-the-visibility-control-center).\n\n### References\n- [Consent management for shippers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014082-consent-management-for-shippers)\n- [Transport Network Onboarding tab](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4376177-transport-network-onboarding-tab)\n- [Providing real-time visibility via your subcarriers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/4885911-providing-real-time-visibility-via-your-subcarriers)\n- [Filtering in the Visibility Control Center](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6028156-filtering-in-the-visibility-control-center)\n```"}

The user is advised to contact the carrier after reasonable time to find out why the invite has not yet been accepted. Users can re-send the invite to the carrier, in order for the carrier to start the onboarding process.\n- **Registered** - The carrier has completed the registration in Transporeon, but is not yet connected to Visibility. Here the user is advised to ask the carrier to access Visibility from the Transporeon main page to finalize the onboarding.\n- **In progress** - The carrier is connected to Visibility, but is still in progress of connecting a visibility source. The user should contact the carrier to see if there are any problems if the status is unchanged after a couple of days.\n- **Ready for tracking** - Visibility source is connected, and the carrier is ready to provide real time visibility.\n- **Connected** - Visibility source is connected, and the carrier has/is providing real-time visibility to its customers through Visibility.\n- **Onboarding stuck** - The onboarding of a carrier is not going as expected because something is missing to finish the integration. The reason why the onboarding is stuck can be found in the carrier's side panel details. Here the user is advised to reach out to the carrier to provide the missing information to Visibility.

The Visibility Control Center is a crucial step, because it will help us to create and maintain trust between you, your carriers, and Visibility Hub. High-quality data is essential for you to monitor your supply chain in real-time. With carriers actively deciding to share data, the quality of Real-time visibility will increase, giving you an even better overview of your supply chain.\n\n**What does data sharing mean?**\n\nSharing Real-time visibility data means that an allocated vehicle will provide real-time data for a given transport.\n\nWhen an allocated license plate is connected to Visibility Hub, our system will check if consent was given to share data with you. Once this is verified, GPS data will be shared for the specific transport.\n\n**Your visibility control center**\n\nUnder the tab \u201cCarrier Network\u201d you see all the Transport companies working with you. Here you can also invite carriers to join your network.  \n\u200b  \n![Carrier Network](The image displays a user interface for a \"Visibility Control Center.\" It features a navigation panel on the left side with options like \"Saved Filters,\" \"Carrier Network,\" and \"Visibility Performance.\" At the top, there is a filter option showing that there are 68 companies tracked for the current week, with a start time set for the week.\n\nThe main section includes a table listing various companies, such as \"Hennel Express\" and \"Schmidt Express,\" alongside columns for actions, transport counts (e.g., 123 transports for Hennel Express), and an onboarding status indicating that all companies listed are \"Connected.\" The layout suggests a focus on logistics or transport management.)\n\nThe consent status shows which carriers have accepted or declined to share data with you during a transport.\n\n**Accepted**\n\nThe carrier has agreed to share real-time visibility data from his network with you during a specific transport.\n\n**Declined**\n\nThe carrier has actively declined sharing real-time visibility data with you.\n\nIf a carrier has declined the data sharing, you will see this in your transport network. Also if a transport is executed by a carrier who declined data sharing, you will be informed about a data sharing issue, when the transport was supposed to start.  \n\u200b  \n![Data Sharing Issue](The image appears to be a screenshot from a tracking or logistics application. It displays a message indicating that \"Tracking was cancelled\" with a red background, signifying an error or alert. Below this message, it states \"No truck allocated.\" The top section shows time settings for the Europe/Vienna time zone (UTC +02:00) along with some additional statistics or icons, although specific details of those icons are not visible in the description. The date and time mentioned are \"Today at 12:46.\")\n\n**Note:** If a carrier has accepted to share data but you still get a notification about a data sharing issue, there could be missing consent in the private transport network of the carrier. Ask your carrier to check the consent status of his carrier network.\n\nIf a carrier has declined the data sharing, reach out to the carrier directly and ask for the consent to be reactivated. This can be done by an admin user in just two clicks. ([Find out if you are an admin](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/8473503-user-roles-in-visibility-hub))\n\n**Best practice**\n\n- Check out your carrier network on a regular basis to make sure consent is accepted - and ask the same of your carriers.\n- Ask your carriers to make sure they have invited all their subcontractors they are using for your transports\n\nShould you have any further questions please contact [support.transporeon.com](https://support.transporeon.com/)\n\n### References\n\n- [Find out if you are an admin](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/8473503-user-roles-in-visibility-hub) - Find out if you are an admin on Visibility Hub.\n- [support.transporeon.com](https://support.transporeon.com/) - Support for additional questions and assistance."}

The logo is formed by black segments that appear to create the shape of a letter \"S.\" The segments are angular and have a slightly three-dimensional look, giving a modern and dynamic feel. The overall design is simple yet bold, with a strong contrast between the black logo and the yellow background.)\n\nIn the Visibility Hub two different types of users exist: \"Admin users\" and \"Regular users\".\n\nThe first user who joins Visibility Hub automatically becomes an Admin user. \n\n#### How to find the users in your company:\n\n1. Go to \"Account actions\" in the VH UI (bottom left corner) and click on \"Settings\"  \n   \u200b![Image](The image shows a user interface for a software application called \"Visibility Hub,\" focusing on the section for \"Delayed transports.\" \n\nOn the left side, there are several menu options, including \"Dashboards,\" \"Road transports,\" \"Visibility Control Center,\" and \"Places.\" Below that, there are options for \"Help,\" \"Account actions,\" and user information for \"Manuela Rott,\" indicating the user's email and associated organizations.\n\nThe main area features a map of Europe on the right, with no current delayed transports displayed (indicated by \"No transports\"). There are also options for filtering and exporting data, along with tabs for tracking status, such as \"Tracking,\" \"On time,\" \"Delayed,\" \"Unknown,\" \"Upcoming,\" \"Untracked,\" and \"Completed.\" The user interface is designed for logistics or transportation management, with emphasis on tracking transport statuses.)  \n\n2. Choose the tab \"Users\" to see all users of your company.  \n   There you can find the overview of your company's users. The list is in an alphabetical order. Admins can be found on the bottom of the list.  \n   \u200b![Image](The image appears to be a screenshot of a user interface from a software application called \"Visibility Hub.\" \n\nHere are the key features visible in the image:\n\n- **Sidebar Menu**: On the left side, there are icons and labels for different sections such as \"Dashboards,\" \"Road transports,\" and \"Ocean transports.\"\n- **Settings Area**: The main section shows the \"Settings\" tab with subcategories: \"Company profile,\" \"Integrations,\" and \"Users.\" The tab for \"Users\" is highlighted in yellow.\n- **User Count**: At the bottom, there is a display indicating that there are 30 users.\n\nOverall, it looks like a dashboard focused on user management and related settings within the application.)  \n\n#### Are you an admin or regular user?\n\nGo to the users list as described above. Admins can be recognized by the **green label \"Admin\"**.  \nIf you are an admin yourself you can see three dots next to each name, which regular users won't see.  \n\u200b![Image](The image displays a user interface element that shows user information. It includes the name \"Manuela Rott,\" followed by the designation \"Admin\" highlighted in green. There are initials \"MR\" represented in a circular format, and an email address, \"manuela@sixfold.com,\" is provided below the name. There are also three dots (representing additional options) at the far right of the interface. The overall design appears clean and minimalistic.)\n\n#### Examples of what actions Admins can do:\n\n- User Management\n  - Remove users\n  - Add users\n  - Promote regular users to admins  \n  \u200b\n- Feature Places & Geofences\n  - [create Places](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5052924-create-a-new-place) (Shipper)\n  - [adjust](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5017030-adjust-the-geofence-of-a-place) & [customize](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/5922241-customising-geofences) Geofences (Shipper)  \n  \u200b\n- [create company wide filters](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6028156-filtering-in-the-visibility-control-center)  \n  \u200b\n- change Consent Management\n  - [Shippers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014082-consent-management-for-shippers)\n  - [Carriers](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/6014068-consent-management-for-carriers)\n\n#### Examples of what actions Admins cannot do:\n\n- \"downgrade\" admins to regular users.  \n  If you want to turn an admin into a regular user, please reach out to support.transporeon.com/customercare  \n  \u200b\n```"}

([Find out if you have an admin role](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/8473503-user-roles-in-visibility-hub))**\n\nThe following steps explain how to create a place in Visibility Hub.\n\n- **Go to the Places view and click the \"+\" button next to the search bar.**  \n  ![Image](The image displays a user interface for a map or location-based application. On the left side, there's a list of places, including names and addresses like \"Amazon BCN2\" and \"Amsterdam.\" A search bar is prominently displayed at the top, where users can search for places by name. To the right, there's a blue map area, which possibly shows a geographical representation of the places listed. A yellow \"+\" button is highlighted in a red box, likely indicating an option to add a new location or entry. The overall design features a clean layout with easy navigation options.)\n\n- **You will now see a map with all transport addresses that Visibility Hub has received from you. Each address represents either a loading or unloading stop from a previous transport.**  \n  **Addresses marked with a blue dot are already connected to a place.**  \n  ![Image](The image displays a digital interface featuring a map of Europe alongside a list of addresses. This interface appears to be a location selection tool. \n\nOn the left side, there is a search bar for finding an address, and below that, a list of addresses in a vertical format. Each entry includes details such as street name, postal code, and city, with some addresses indicating a connection to a specific entity, for example, \"BB Fabric Berlin.\" \n\nTo the right, a map highlights various locations with black dots, likely representing points of interest or specific addresses mentioned in the list. The map covers several countries in Europe, including Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, among others.)\n\n- **Select the address for which you want to create a place for from either the map, the scrollable list or via the search bar. Click on that address and the Place creation view opens.**  \n  ![Image](The image displays a user interface for creating a new location in an application. On the left side, there are sections labeled for naming the location, defining a geofence, and selecting linked addresses.\n\n1. **Location Name**: A field is provided where the user can enter a name (in this case, \"Tartu\").\n2. **Geofence Definition**: There are options to select either a \"Circular\" or \"Custom\" shape for the geofence, which is meant to define the area for tracking.\n3. **Linked Addresses**: A section for selecting addresses linked to this place, with one address selected (Anne 47, 50606, Tartu, EE) and a possible alias (Jaama 173, 50705, Tartu, EE).\n4. **Map Area**: To the right, there\u2019s a map displaying the city of Tartu, with a circular geofence outlined in yellow, covering an estimated radius of 2000 meters.\n5. **Action Buttons**: At the bottom, there are options to \"Cancel\" or \"Create place.\"\n\nOverall, this interface is designed to help users set up a geofenced location for tracking purposes, centered around Tartu.)\n\n- **Here you can enter the name of the new place, add potential aliases (duplicate or very close-by addresses) and, most importantly, adjust the geofence by moving the pin on the map to the correct location of where your trucks will be arriving or passing through. This ensures the correct tracking of all incoming traffic.**  \n  ![Image](The image displays a user interface for creating a new location in a mapping application. It is divided into sections with the following components:\n\n1. **Name Input**: A field where the user can set a name for the location, which is filled in as \"Tartu\".\n2. **Geofence Definition**: Options to define a geofence, allowing users to choose between a circular or custom shape. This section emphasizes the importance of covering the location effectively for better tracking quality.\n3. **Linked Addresses Selection**: A section to select addresses linked to the new place. One address (\"Anne 47, 50606, Tartu, EE\") is pre-selected, and a possible alias (\u201cJaama 173, 50705, Tartu, EE\u201d) is shown below.\n4. **Map Area**: A map of Tartu, Estonia, is visible on the right side, displaying roads, rivers, and the surrounding area, with a circular geofence outlined.\n5. **Action Buttons**: At the bottom, there are buttons labeled \"Cancel\" and \"Create place,\" indicating actions the user can take.\n\nOverall, the interface appears straightforward, aimed at efficiently setting up location tracking.)\n\n- **Once you click the \"Create place\" button, your new place will be added. The screen then changes to the warehouse view of this place and sooner or later you should see the first trucks approaching your place.**  \n  ![Image](The image displays a user interface, likely from a logistics or delivery application. On the left side, there's a list titled \"Places,\" showing various locations, including several Amazon facilities and cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin, and Moscow. The currently selected location is \"Tartu,\" which is highlighted and includes its address. \n\nOn the right side, there is a section titled \"Approaching,\" indicating that there are no shipments currently approaching this site, as illustrated by an empty state with the message \"No transports approaching site.\" The interface features options for searching and adding places, and the overall layout appears to be organized and user-friendly.)\n\n### References\n- Find out if you have an admin role: [User Roles in Visibility Hub](https://intercom.help/sixfold/en/articles/8473503-user-roles-in-visibility-hub)\n```"}
